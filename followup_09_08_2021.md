[[Video](#orgb167398)]

This session was a bit of an experiment: I didn't know if it would
work to show you a video and discuss it - given the results (see
whiteboards), I think it did, and we'll develop the section
"History of AI" over several sessions using the remainder of this
video, which is rich in examples.

Going back to original sources (like this video) isn't really
common outside of the field of history of science, because of the
reasons discussed in class: technology seems to move too fast to
bother with anything older than 10 years. However, in practice, you
are constantly confronted with the history of computer science -
via us, your instructors. Good instructors are rarely younger than
40, which means that they can look 20 years into the past. Older
ones (50-70) can look even further. At some point, the advantage of
knowing the past may tip over into a disadvantage of being wed to
it. I have not personally experienced this - but I still have a few
years to go before I reach the critical threshold<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>.


## Metropolis (1927)

Alas, I kind of botched the plot description of this film. In
fact, it's eerily more like the 2020's - it involves identity
theft and transfer of the stolen identity of the female
protagonist, Maria to the robot (aka "Hel"), who "unleashes chaos
throughout Metropolis, driving men to murder and stirring dissent
among the workers."

In fact, the plot [summary on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_(1927_film)#Plot) is so confused that I
recommend you watch the film for yourself! [It's on YouTube](https://youtu.be/OZ_mcUz8hkQ)<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>.

Whatever the whole story, this is Frankenstein with
robots. Interestingly, I had a conversation with a Catholic priest
yesterday where he likened social media to Frankenstein, and I
Frankenstein has been used as a metaphor for data science ([Reaney,
2017](#org20cd094)).


## Darling Sweetheart (1951)

The challenge: "Can computers really create anything new?"

The answer by [Ferranti Mark 1 (1951)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferranti_Mark_1):

> Darling Sweethart
> You are my avid fellow feeling
> My affection curiously clings
> to your passionate wish. My
> liking yearns to your heart. You
> \#are my wistful sympathy: my
> tender liking.
> Yours beautifully,
> Manchester University Computer

## Samuel's checkers bot

(1970).*

> "Samuel's papers on machine learning are still worth studying. With
> great creativity and working essentially alone, doing his own
> programming, he invented several seminal techniques in rote learning
> and generalization learning, using such underlying techniques as
> mutable evaluation functions, hill climbing, and signature tables. One
> still hears proposals for research in this area less sophisticated
> than his work of the 1950s." ([McCarthy, 1990](#org3bd4d36))

Samuel's original article that first introduced the term "machine
learning" is highly readable ([Samuel, 1959](#org271b81c)). I've assigned it to
students as a term project in the past. The abstract of the
reprint (2000) reads as follows:

> "The studies reported here have been concerned with the
> programming of a digital computer to behave in a way which, if
> done by human beings or animals, would be described as involving
> the process of learning. While this is not the place to dwell on
> the importance of machine-learning procedures, or to discourse on
> the philosophical aspects,1 there is obviously a very large amount
> of work, now done by people, which is quite trivial in its demands
> on the intellect but does, nevertheless, involve some learning. We
> have at our command computers with adequate data-handling ability
> and with sufficient computational speed to make use of
> machine-learning techniques, but our knowledge of the basic
> principles of these techniques is still rudimentary. Lacking such
> knowledge, it is necessary to specify methods of problem solution
> in minute and exact detail, a time-consuming and costly
> procedure. Programming computers to learn from experience should
> eventually eliminate the need for much of this detailed
> programming effort."

There is a followup article ([Samuel, 1967](#orgb3874a7)).

# Footnotes

<sup><a id="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> In the 1960s and 70s there was a saying "don't trust anyone
above 30". I'm arguing for the opposite here.

<sup><a id="fn.2" href="#fnr.2">2</a></sup> I have it on blueray disc - when this term is over, perhaps we
should put on an "AI movie night", whaddayathink?
