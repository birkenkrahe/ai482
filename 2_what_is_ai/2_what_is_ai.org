  Which fields of inquiry (= disciplines) to use?

** Fields of systematic inquiry

   #+attr_html: :height 200px
   [[./img/fields.gif]]

   * Language
   * Philosophy
   * Science
   * History

** Fundamental questions

   #+attr_html: :width 500px
   [[./img/humanmachine.jpg]]

   * Should we focus on humans?
   * Should we focus on machines?

** Four approaches

   |               | *THOUGHT / LOGIC*    | *BEHAVIOR / ACTION* |
   |---------------+----------------------+---------------------|
   | *HUMANITY*    | /Cognitive modeling/ | /Turing Test/       |
   | *RATIONALITY* | /Laws of Thought/    | /Rational Agents/   |

*** Four scenarios

    #+attr_html: :height 500px
    [[./img/approaches1.png]]

*** Acting humanly ("Turing test" approach)

    | Natural language processing |
    | Knowledge representation    |
    | Automated reasoning         |
    | Machine learning            |
    | Computer vision             |
    | Robotics                    |

*** Thinking humanly ("cognitive modeling" approach)

    |  Introspection              |
    |  Psychological experiments  |
    |  Brain imaging              |
    |  Cognitive science          |
    |  Algorithms                 |

*** Thinking rationally ("laws of thought" approach)

    |  Syllogistic reasoning  |
    |  Logic                  |
    |  Expert systems         |
    |  Uncertainty            |
    |  Probability            |

*** Acting rationally ("rational agent" approach)

    |  Combination approach   |
    |  Constructivist         |
    |  Doing the right thing  |
    |  Standard model         |
    |  Control theory         |

* Major issues

  #+attr_html: :height 200px
  [[./img/issues.gif]]

  * Bounded Rationality
  * Value alignment problem

** Bounded rationality

   Image: [[bakopoulos1985][Bakopoulos, 1985]]

   #+begin_quote
   AIMA: "For perfect rationality, the computational demands are just
   too high."
   #+end_quote

** Value alignment

   #+attr_html: :width 200px
   [[./img/mechanicalturk.png]]

   Image: [[https://www.amazon.com/Turk-Famous-Eighteenth-Century-Chess-Playing-Machine/dp/B000HWZ28Q][The Mechanical Turk]]

   #+begin_quote
   AIMA: "The values or objectives put into the machine must be
   aligned with those of the human."
   #+end_quote

** Group work

   #+attr_html: :height 200px
   [[./img/groupwork.gif]]

   * Get together in groups of 2-3
   * Each group covers one approach
   * List pros and cons of your approach
   * Put your results [[https://ideaboardz.com/for/AI%20approaches%20pros%20&amp;%20cons/4063343][on the Kanban board]]

* [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics][Asimov's robot laws]]

** Which appoach fits these laws?

   1) A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow
      a human being to come to harm.
   2) A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except
      where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
   3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such
      protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
