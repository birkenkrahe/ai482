  Which fields of inquiry (= disciplines) to use?

** Fields of systematic inquiry

   #+attr_html: :height 200px
   [[./img/fields.gif]]

   * Language
   * Philosophy
   * Science
   * History

** Fundamental questions

   #+attr_html: :width 500px

   * Should we focus on humans?
   * Should we focus on machines?

** Four approaches

   |               | *THOUGHT / LOGIC*    | *BEHAVIOR / ACTION* |
   |---------------+----------------------+---------------------|
   | *HUMANITY*    | /Cognitive modeling/ | /Turing Test/       |
   | *RATIONALITY* | /Laws of Thought/    | /Rational Agents/   |

*** Four scenarios

    #+attr_html: :height 500px
    [[./img/approaches1.png]]

*** Acting humanly ("Turing test" approach)

   | Natural language processing |
   | Knowledge representation    |
   | Automated reasoning         |
   | Machine learning            |
   | Computer vision             |
   | Robotics                    |

*** Thinking humanly ("cognitive modeling" approach)

    |  Introspection              |
    |  Psychological experiments  |
    |  Brain imaging              |
    |  Cognitive science          |
    |  Algorithms                 |

*** Thinking rationally ("laws of thought" approach)

    |  Syllogistic reasoning  |
    |  Logic                  |
    |  Expert systems         |
    |  Uncertainty            |
    |  Probability            |

*** Acting rationally ("rational agent" approach)

    |  Combination approach   |
    |  Constructivist         |
    |  Doing the right thing  |
    |  Standard model         |
    |  Control theory         |

* Major issues

  #+attr_html: :height 200px

  * Bounded Rationality
  * Value alignment problem

** Bounded rationality
