## "Essay" project process

Three processes are aligned with one another for the project,
which in this course is an AI application ([cp. Syllabus](https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/blob/main/syllabus.md#grading-system)):

1.  term: beginning mid August, ending in early December. Mid-term
    grades are independent of the project.
2.  Scrum: four sprints with four sprint reviews roughly four weeks
    apart. at a sprint review, you present the status of your essay
    prototype.
3.  IMRaD: the introduction with research question (what you wish
    to investigate), the method (how you are going to do it), your
    results (what you found out), and the discussion of your
    results (what it means, how it benefits whom, including the
    limitations of your investigation).

In week 3 (Aug 30-Sep 3) we will focus on generating ideas and get
the project set up properly (1st sprint review). [See also the FAQs](https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.md)
