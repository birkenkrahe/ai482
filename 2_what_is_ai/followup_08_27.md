## "AI Application" project process

Three processes are aligned with one another for the project,
which in this course is an AI application ([cp. Syllabus](https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/blob/main/syllabus.md#grading-system)):

1.  term: beginning mid August, ending in early December. Mid-term
    grades are independent of the project.
2.  Scrum: four sprints with four sprint reviews roughly four weeks
    apart. at a sprint review, you present the status of your essay
    prototype.
3.  IMRaD: the introduction with research question (what you wish
    to investigate), the method (how you are going to do it), your
    results (what you found out), and the discussion of your
    results (what it means, how it benefits whom, including the
    limitations of your investigation).

In week 3 (Aug 30-Sep 3) we will focus on generating ideas and get
the project set up properly (1st sprint review). [See also the FAQs](https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.md)

## Book recommendations

[George Dyson, Turing's Cathedral](https://www.amazon.com/Turings-Cathedral-Origins-Digital-Universe/dp/1400075998). Vintage books (2012).

> "In the 1940s and ‘50s, a small group of men and women—led by John von
> Neumann—gathered in Princeton, New Jersey, to begin building one of
> the first computers to realize Alan Turing’s vision of a Universal
> Machine. The codes unleashed within this embryonic, 5-kilobyte
> universe—less memory than is allocated to displaying a single icon on
> a computer screen today—broke the distinction between numbers that
> mean things and numbers that do things, and our universe would never
> be the same. Turing’s Cathedral is the story of how the most
> constructive and most destructive of twentieth-century inventions—the
> digital computer and the hydrogen bomb—emerged at the same time."

I also recommended virtually any book by the George Dyson's
father, [Freeman Dyson (Princeton, Institute for Advanced Study)](https://www.ias.edu/sns/dyson).


## Google scholar alert

I use this alert to remain informed about current articles - when
I find something directly relevant to a course, I put it in the
bookmarks file. You may need to have to register ([here's my
account](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Vvnwsv0AAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1)).

Since the Google search algorithm is not known, the alert is not
reliable (in the sense that one might miss an important
publication). The best alternative is to look for recent
literature review articles.
