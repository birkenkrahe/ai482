# Protocol (Aug 23, 2021)

By Marcus Birkenkrahe (MB) aka "The professor"

This was the 2nd week of the course, and the first week with
content other than just orientation.

## Housekeeping


### First weekly test

The [test](https://lyon.schoology.com/course/5071626602/materials#!filter_type=assessments) asked about "ANI" for "Artificial Narrow Intelligence",
as opposed to "AGI" for "Artificial General Intelligence". Most
of the practical AI that we see is AI. AGI, or machines that are
(nearly) as intelligent as humans, does not really exist<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>.

One can get preprints (and other research documents) from
researchgate.net (here is [MB's profile](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marcus-Birkenkrahe)). Like arxiv.org, this
site is not curated though, i.e. everyone can put their work
there (without external validation)<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>.

The question "Is AI in data science the same thing as Machine
Learning (ML)?" was tricky, because this is `TRUE` for AI in
data science, while for AI overall, ML is only a sub-field
(though a dominant one at current).

Students should let MB know if they find any mistakes in the
tests.


### Scheduling

Students were supposed to schedule a protocol (like this one),
and a presentation using this document in GitHub. Those who did
not schedule themselves will be assigned a date by MB.

MB said this was the first time that he had people write
protocols, and that he was open to pretty much anything<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>.


### Diary

MB writes irregular diary entries on GitHub, one diary is for
all courses, the other one only for this course. [In his general
diary](https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/diary.md#org5bbaf46), he complained about having to teach masked students.


## Session Topic: What is AI?


### Career advice

MB showed the home pages of the two authors of AIMA (2021), the
main textbook for the course. One of them is Google's director
of research, Peter Norvig. One way to establish a relationship
with people like these is to look at their [publications](http://www.norvig.com/), and ask
them questions - make contact via shared interests.


### Pair exercise - What is intelligence?

Students were supposed to develop definitions of "intelligence"
and "artificial intelligence". MB did not offer any
solution. Instead, he went through the 5 different attempts and
analyzed each of them: he pointed out differences and
similarities. 

Most definitions of AI boiled down to a form of human
intelligence executed by a machine. Different forms of
intelligence were mentioned: the ability to think abstractly,
solve problems, adapt, and learn. 

Knowledge and information were distinguished. In "Knowledge
Management", data, information, knowledge and wisdom can be seen
as a ladder:

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col" class="org-left">Wisdom</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">Knowledge</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">Information</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">Data</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

According to [Weinberger (2010)](#orgdbdab64), this hierarchy goes back to the
poem "The Rock" by T.S. Eliot. As the article points out, there
are several issues with this hierarchy. It comes from a time
when data wasn't supposed to be of much value, while today,
"Data Is The New Oil" ([Bhageshpur, 2019](#orge4d2eb7)).

MB asked if the students had thought of people, processes or
products (a common framework in quality management and in
[entrepreneurship](#orgcad5bba)) when coming up with the definitions, and all
three approaches were represented.


### Lecture

One can approach big topics like AI from different angles:
language (e.g. definitions, as in the group exercise);
philosophy or history (classical liberal arts disciplines); or
science. Science is useful when a quantitative treatment is
possible (i.e. when there are observations that one can make and
quantify or measure).

The two opposing fundamental questions when looking at AI are:
should we focus on humans, or should we focus on machines?
Currently (perhaps because human intelligence is too hard to
study and/or imitate), the focus is more strongly on machine
intelligence.

Four approaches can be identified:

-   AI that has human behavior (as in the 1985 film "Terminator")
-   AI that has human thought (as in the 2013 film "Her")
-   AI that has rational thought (as in the 1998 film "Pi")
-   AI that has rational behavior (as in the 2002 film "Minority
    Report")


## Summary view

I liked the group exercise as an opportunity to interact, get up
and do something (instead of just being talked at). I thought it
was interesting how many different definitions of "intelligence"
the students came up with. Among the different perspectives on
AI, I'm looking forward to philosophy and history.

# Footnotes

<sup><a id="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> Though there are isolated achievements of AGI, like when a
machine (Deep Blue) beat the world chess champion, Gary Kasparov, or
when the IBM Watson won Jeopardy!, or when Google's Alpha Go beat the
best Go player in the world.

<sup><a id="fn.2" href="#fnr.2">2</a></sup> Another useful search engine is ScienceDirect - not for
preprints but for properly published scientific articles and
books. See for example the result for "[Turing Test](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/turing-test)".

<sup><a id="fn.3" href="#fnr.3">3</a></sup> This protocol is an example protocol to see how it could be
done. However, you should feel free to define your own format - the
simple instruction is to reflect upon a classroom session and submit
the protocol within one week from the session. The protocol does not need to be complete, or
elegant, or have any particular length. You can put a lot or little
time into it. Your effort will or course be reflected in the
grade. The mandatory protocol makes up 15% of your grade. For
additional protocols, you can get extra credit.
