# Preamble

As always, this framework presentation will be fully equipped with
more material after the live classroom session on Oct 6, 2021.

-   Protocol anyone?
-   Whiteboard photos


<a id="orgb434ed2"></a>

# What will you learn?

-   Broaden the view from Andrew Ng's focus
-   Check impact of intelligent agent paradigm
-   Understand method/content/impact of [AI100 (2021)](#org776f632)
-   Develop AI literacy (critical thinking)
-   Quick group exercise to check understanding OR
-   Hard philosopho-technical question to brood over

## Definition

> "Artificial intelligence is about getting a machine to carry out
> behaviors that we think of as requiring intelligence."

"AI effect:" once a problem is solved by AI, it is no longer
considered an AI problem - e.g. "real-time navigation aids that
decide when and how to describe upcoming turns to guide you to your
destination."


<a id="org4e42f0b"></a>

## Goals

-   Impact of AI on people and societies worldwide
-   Articulate "standing questions"
-   Initiate discussion
-   Influence policy and curricular decisions


<a id="org0a90aa4"></a>

## Method

Remember common critical questions: relevance (how important is
it?) and validation (why should I trust it?)

# Information

Standing Questions (SQ):

1.  What are some Pictures that reflect important AI progress?
2.  What are the most important advances in AI?
3.  What are the most inspiring open grand challenge problems?
4.  How much have we progressed in understanding the key mysteries of
    human intelligence?
5.  What are the prospects for more general artificial intelligence?
6.  How has public sentiment towards AI evolved, and how should we
    inform/educate the public?
7.  How should governments act to ensure AI is developed and used
    responsibly?
8.  What should the roles of academia and industry be, respectively,
    in the development and deployment of AI technologies and the
    study of the impacts of AI?
9.  What are the most promising opportunities for AI?
10. What are the most pressing dangers of AI?
11. How has AI impacted socioeconomic relationships?
12. Does it appear "building in how we think" works as an
    engineering strategy in the long run?

Check some of these out for relevance to your presentation topics
(some interesting references though overall lack of quantitative
data).

# Knowledge

Any thoughts about this summary (p.71)?

> "Complete autonomy is not the eventual goal for AI systems. [&#x2026;] AI
> needs to be incorporated into that community-wide system, with clear
> lines of communication between human and automated
> decision-makers. [&#x2026;] The success of the field will be measured by
> how it has empowered all people, not be how efficiently machines
> devalue the very people we are trying to help."


<a id="orge265691"></a>

## Scenario analysis

Place SQs in scenario framework:

-   problem vs. solution focus
-   soft (socio-political) vs. hard (mathematical-technical)

Result:

-   Soft problems: 4,5,6,10,11
-   Soft solutions: 1,7,8
-   Hard problems: 3
-   Hard solutions: 2,9,12

# Wisdom

Question: What is the relationship between AI and God (if any)?

> “It’s only for me, and — but I but I personally think of my belief
> that God exists, although I have no idea what that means. But I
> believe that there is something beyond human capabilities — and it
> might be some AI, but whatever, but I do believe that there is
> something that goes beyond the realm of human understanding, that I
> can try to learn more about how to resonate with, whatever that
> being would like me to do.” [Donald Knuth (2021)](#orgb77bbd8)

# Footnotes

<sup><a id="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> Though the authors claim that the 2nd report 2021 should broaden
the vision of AI beyond "North American cities" (2016), there are no
Standing Committee members from Continental Europe, or from
Asia. While Microsoft Research is participating, Google and Amazon are
absent.
