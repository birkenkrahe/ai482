# Housekeeping
  ### Protocols
  The first topic covered during housekeeping was Protocols. This class would mark the start of students writing the protocols. The example protocol was also discussed. The example protocol should not be a template for the students to follow exactly. Each protocol should be a personal reflection in the class. The importance of avoiding grammar mistakes was another topic covered. Dr. Birkenkrahe made a list of helpful tips to avoid grammar mistakes for the students:
  -	Use an application
  -	Use a friend(peer review)
  -	Compose away from github
  ### "Start with a bang end with a bang in between can be forgotten"-Dr. Birkenkrahe

  ### Bookmarks
  The bookmarks are articles that Dr.Birkenkrahe has found which pertain to the class. He collected the articles and labeled them with a numbering system, which ascends according to the complexity of the piece. The bookmarks can be found [here](https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/blob/main/bookmarks.md)
 ### Missing sessions
  It was unamiously voted that lectures should be recorded for students who may have unexpected abscenses from class. If a student is absent from class he or she would be able to watch the video at a later time in order to stay caught up with the material. The recordings discussed will be on a google meet. 
# Lecture
  The lecture began with a recap of the last class period. He asks the question "should AI foucus on Humans?" to the class again. After a brief discussion he uses the comparison of a vaccuming robot to cleaning maid to segway into the conversation of human thought vs rational thought.
  #### The Turing test
  The turing test is a test developed for an AI in order to see if it can act like a human.[more information on the Turing Test] (https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/turing-test/), a 
  #### Acting Humanly vs Acting Rationally
  Humans have feelings and emotions which causes us to act in illogical ways. Human thought is sporadic and influenced by feelings, culture, background, bias etc. However a machine does not expierence these same feelings. This is where the difference comes. This is not to say that human thought is totally irrational but when each is taken to the extremes, they are polar opposites.
 # Reflection
  I thought that this lecture was very interesting, and some new topics were brought up. One thing that I found especially interesting about this lecture was the discussion of bias in regard to tests, such as the Turing test, that are subject to bias because of their repetitive nature. The more the tests are done the more people want to see it successfully completed. The concepts of different forms of thought was also a new topic that made me really think about the humanitarian aspects of AI. If an artificial intelligence is based wholly on rational thought can it be considered human at all 
  and could we trust it to make the best decisions without any sense of moralityI am generally feeling good about the course as a whole and i am very excited for the rest of this semester.
 ### Fun Stuff
  Today Dr.B  wore a shirt from Walmart that he was very excited about because he had never bought a Walmart shirt before. 
  Dr. B also had to figure out how to work a google meet when the camera came on and he saw his face on the screen he exclaimed “oh my god”.
  George Dyson did not invent the Dyson Vacuum.
