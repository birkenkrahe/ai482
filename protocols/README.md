# Session Protocols

Post your protocol here. Take a look at [my example protocol](https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/blob/main/2_what_is_ai/protocol_23_aug.md).

# [AI in the military (Jacob Sampley, 13-Oct-2021)](https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/blob/main/presentations/Sampley_Autonomous%20Drones%20in%20the%20U.S.%20Military.pdf)

This presentation was totally worth staying up for all night - very
well done (apart from Jacob's time mgmt prior to the presentation
;-). A great start to the solo presentation series! Jacob really
used his time well: the number of slides was just right for 45
min. 30 min speaking + discussion.

I hope to pick this up at the start on Wed, perhaps re: technology,
because we didn't talk about that at all.

Some potential points of improvement<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>:

1.  There was a clear **research question**, in the subtitle (perhaps
    even a **hypothesis**?). It would have been good to directly answer
    it at the end, "main message" style. Like a paper, a presentation
    benefits from a summary/conclusion. All the information was
    there, on the slides, which were partly organized like a
    paper<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>.
2.  **Audience interaction**: questions to the audience should always
    be **open questions** if you want a discussion, and only closed
    questions for a poll-like interaction (which does wake people
    up): it's sometimes good to ask these throughout the talk.
3.  **Graphics:** Use bar plots instead of tables unless the tables are
    really simple (less than 3-4 rows, and columns). Pie charts are
    also near useless - they worked here only because you had only 2
    categories per chart.
4.  Especially when masked, **diction** is important. When presenting,
    speak slowly, more measured, repeat main points etc. I am setting
    a bad example<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>.

All in all, this was a fantastic presentation, excellently sourced
and delivered, and the questions were well answered and dealt with.

I really enjoyed it - I'm only sorry that I talked so much. You
opened that Pandora box when you permitted questions
throughout. Hope that others will ask more questions in future
presentations!

# [AI in soccer to improve athlete performance (Emma Brandes, 15-Oct-2021)](https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/blob/main/presentations/AI%20in%20soccer%20to%20improve%20athlete%20performance%20DUE%20Nov%2015%20(1).pdf)

Emma presented really interesting, current examples, compared them
and gave us a timeline for these performance and player
performance-oriented applications. She gathered primary data (from
team mates and from her own experience). Excellent amount of
material for session and discussion. The discussion focused on the
actual advantage of these applications for the player, and on the
potential loss of playing skills through data overload. Really
enjoyed the illustration through devices brought to class and
through the video selection.

Points of improvement:

1.  when talking stats, **show** some stats (numbers, tables etc.)
2.  give a better idea on how these devices yield better player
    performance (beyond the commercial hype)
3.  a little more **technical** insight - what exactly is AI here? One
    could e.g. apply models that we have already learnt about, like
    PEAS for intelligent agents. Are these intelligent agents?
4.  **References** ought to include video and image material

# [Problem Solving & Searching Algorithms (Dat O, 22-Oct-2021)](https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/blob/main/presentations/Presentation-DatO.pdf)

This presentation was based on chapter 3 (pp. 81-128) of AIMA. Like
all full chapters in the textbook, it packed a punch - I could
easily lecture for a week on every one of the 6 sub chapters<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup>.

Dat did an amazing job of giving an overview of a vast field. He
connected the presented material to previous courses (like
algorithms, data structures etc.), and chose illustrations taken
from educational videos.

I thought it was a thorough introduction that left out exactly what
needed to be left out. Dat used almost the entire time but we still
got to discuss several interesting issues at the end, like:

-   Which skills do you need to work with these algorithms in practice?
-   How much research (if any) is still done in this area (much of it
    is part of the compsci undergraduate curriculum)?
-   Which algorithms are used in which current AI applications?

Especially the last question will be relevant to other presenters as
well. Because there is so much more in this chapter, it will be
useful to you to read it - and much easier now that Dat has given us
an overview.

The solo presentation is also a good stepping stone on his way to
the final presentation and prototype, which will deal with genetic
algorithms.

Points of improvement: almost none. I had wished to see some
implementations (as in: code) for the benefit of those who know how
to write and read code. In AIMA, this is done using pseudocode.

A little more thought about how to get the audience involved would
have improved this presentation even more. This could go as far as
to give them a small task and ask for example, which algorithm would
be suitable for a given sample problem.

Lastly, the examples could have been presented in a closed form -
such a slide would have been easy to memorize. A number of
interesting examples were mentioned.

# Footnotes

<sup><a id="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> Remember: unless explicitly noted, the assumption is that lists
are ordered. The human mind orders them automatically from top to
bottom. Keep this in mind by using numbering and by putting the most
important stuff to the top (especially important in presentations
because people run out of time towards the end of slides and/or
presentations).

<sup><a id="fn.2" href="#fnr.2">2</a></sup> In fact, at second thought, it would have been better to choose
either essay or presentation mode.

<sup><a id="fn.3" href="#fnr.3">3</a></sup> I really don't have any excuses: foreigners and teachers should
be held to much more stringent presentation standards. Alas, because
we speak so much, and audiences are often silent and forgiving (unlike
in business), bad habits tend to fester. Also, many teachers are
resistant to change.

<sup><a id="fn.4" href="#fnr.4">4</a></sup> I had meant to work through the chapter weeks ago but then one
thing happened and then another and I didn't get to reading through it
until shortly before the presentation, and I found it very difficult,
even with my background. A lot of the descriptions and examples in
AIMA are exceptionally dense. Several of the footnotes and the
bibliography hide recent research and are state-of-the-art. AIMA is
definitely not a typical textbook in this regard - just like AI is not
a typical course topic (because it's evolving so fast in front of your
very eyes!).
