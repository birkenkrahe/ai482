* What will you learn?

  * Using supervised and unsupervised ML
  * Identifying customer groups / churn / upselling
  * Case study: using AI on electric grid data

** Problem: personalization at scale

   * Customers respond best to *personalized* messages[fn:5]
   * AI delivers personalization *at scale*[fn:4]

     #+begin_quote
     "With AI, you can reach personalization at scale, learning about
     people from their specific actions and characteristics and targeting
     them for who they really are and not for the handcrafted bucket they
     fall into."
     #+end_quote

     /Is this statement true? Is "who you really are" hidden in the
     data that you generate as customers?/

** Marketing sample problems

   * Identifying which customers are likely to leave your service
     ("churn")
   * Identifying which customers are likely to buy a new service
   * Identifying simlar customer groups (customer segmentation)

     Remember the basic process (as a BPMN diagram):

** Predicting churning customers

   | Churn | percentage of customers leaving a business over time |

   * Label: customer belongs to one of two classes[fn:6]:
     - Class 0 = not churned (still active)
     - Class 1 = customer about to churn (jump ship)
   * Identify features

     /Which phase is missing in this model?/

** Measuring algorithm performance

   * Statistical vs. practical metrics:
     - Link between stats and decisions not obvious
   * Dealing with errors:
     - Not all errors are the same

** Accuracy, precision and recall

*** Definitions

    | Accuracy  | What's the ratio of correct vs total predictions?        |
    | Precision | How many predicted customers were really going to churn? |
    | Recall    | How many customers who churned were predicted?           |

*** Business use

*** Health care application

** Perform automatic customer segmentation

   | Segmentation | Group customers who share behaviors and characteristics |

   Typical marketing questions:
   * Should we group people aged 20-25 or those aged 20-29?
   * Can we put large and small city students in one cluster?
   * Should we put males and females in different clusters?

   Ways to decide all depend on *patterns*:
   * Go by your gut feeling ("1980s")
   * Look at the data (EDA) and let marketing decide
   * Let AI cluster customer segments

*** Unsupervised learning = finds labels

    #+begin_quote
    "In unsupervised learning, an algorithm is fed with unlabeled
    examples, and is asked to devide the examples into groups that
    share some similarities."
    #+end_quote

** Discussion

   * What are the issues with each of the pattern identification
     methods listed above (gut feeling/EDA/AI)
   * What are some principal technical issues with supervised and
     unsupervised learning?
   * What is the potential cost of letting AI make more and more
     decisions in sales and marketing?

* Footnotes

[fn:6]Note that the choice of label depends on the underlying business
model. Digital services like Netflix or Spotify are easier to deal
with since customers have to actively unsubscribe. Food retail is not
so easy: customers don't tell you that they don't intend to come
back.

[fn:5]It is worth noting that strict personalization is
philosophically impossible because humans are not machines (or
animals): our preferences change over time, often irrationally so.

[fn:4]'Scaling' is a major efficiency quantity in our times of mass
applications. It relates to the ability of anything to apply to large
numbers - ideally at infinitum. "Scaling laws", or power laws,
describe growth where one quantity grows with a power. Exponential
growth is an example. In IT and application development, scaling is
desired for the number of people - e.g. an application on your phone
should scale to any number of concurrent users. This implies demands
on storage, speed, usability, and other characteristics.

[fn:2]The relationship between AI and ML is briefly explained in AIMA
at the start. Part V of the book deals exclusively with machine
learning. The distinctions (data science, AI, machine learning) are
not precise at all though.

[fn:3]We discussed some of them in class. Some issues were also
mentioned by Andrew Ng: data validation and availability; change
management (for deployment); scaling; value identification;
maintenance/debugging.

[fn:1](1) Predicting final grades from midterm and other student
performance data. (2) Predicting how much/which products a customer
will buy depending on his purchasing history. (3) Predicting if a
customer will buy or bail. (3) Predicting if email is spam or not. (4)
Predicting if an image is a cat or dog (or neither).
