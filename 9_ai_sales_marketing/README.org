  Following Mauro/Valigi (2021), we use an online real estate platform
  as an example to illustrate how machine learning can work.

  The core business problem is matching sellers and buyers. The core
  value is the house price. We want to build a machine learning (ML)
  model that predicts house prices based on real estate market data.

  When a new house comes on the market, we want the AI to predict a
  price based on other comparable houses. The AI computes a similarity
  measure.

** Problem

   The machine learning problem - predict the best price for homes
   listed on a real estate platform. /Image: purchasing process./

   /Which other *problems* suited for ML do you know?/[fn:1]

** Process

   Image: Machine learning phases - training, deployment,
   inference.

   /Is this an *agile* process? Why or why not?/

** Data

   Though the availability of data ("Big Data") drives much of the ML
   development, the basic data format and the way the data are used to
   establish ML models, are well known and have long been in use.

*** Data format

    #+attr_html: :width 600px
    [[./img/data.png]]

    Both features and labels are variables. Features are
    given/independent, and labels are targets/dependent. The label
    variables are what we want to predict.

*** Data use

    #+attr_html: :width 600px
    [[./img/data1.png]]

    The available data is split into training and test sets. The
    training data is used to make the model learn, and the test data is
    used to test the model on unknown data, simulating the real-world
    application.

** Programming

*** Rules vs. learning

    How does this kind of program relate to traditional rule-based
    programming?

*** Research vs. deployment

    The story of deployment is a lot more complicated than shown
    here:

    #+begin_quote
    "As little as 5% of the actual code for machine learning
    production systems is the model itself. What turns a collection of
    machine learning solutions into an end-to-end machine learning
    platform is an architecture that embraces technologies designed to
    speed up modelling, automate the deployment, and ensure scalability
    and reliability in production." ([[mlops][Hellstrom, 2020]]) 
    #+end_quote

    Te bulk of the activities listed in this quote form part of the
    "MLOps" challenge that Andrew Ng also mentioned ([[ng][Ng, 2020]]). The
    figure below gives a schematic overview:

** Concepts

   | ML algorithm ("the AI") | Allows computers to learn from data                                  |
   | Features                | Model input, characteristics of an object that the AI can learn from |
   | Label                   | Model output or target we want the AI to predict                     |
   | Training                | Phase when the AI is fed with past features to learn patterns        |
   | Model                   | Output of the training phase, capable of making predictions          |
   | Inference               | Phase in which the model is used with new examples                   |
   | Training data           | Data used to create the model ("learning")                           |
   | Test data               | Data used to test the model                                          |
   | Production data         | Data used to run the model in the field ("deployed")                 |

** Discussion

   [[./img/discussion.gif]]

   * How does machine learning relate to the *"intelligent agents"*
     concept (as in [[aima][AIMA]])?[fn:2]
   * What do you think are the *advantages* and *disadvantages* of
     this approach?[fn:3]
   * Do you *recognize* any of these concepts in your own AI
     application (solo presentation or team project)? Does ML play a
     role here?  Which one?

* Footnotes

[fn:2]The relationship between AI and ML is briefly explained in AIMA
at the start. Part V of the book deals exclusively with machine
learning. The distinctions (data science, AI, machine learning) are
not precise at all though.

[fn:3]We discussed some of them in class. Some issues were also
mentioned by Andrew Ng: data validation and availability; change
management (for deployment); scaling; value identification;
maintenance/debugging.

[fn:1](1) Predicting final grades from midterm and other student
performance data. (2) Predicting how much/which products a customer
will buy depending on his purchasing history. (3) Predicting if a
customer will buy or bail. (3) Predicting if email is spam or not. (4)
Predicting if an image is a cat or dog (or neither).
