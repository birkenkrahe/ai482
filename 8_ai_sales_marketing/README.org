* ML basics

  Following Mauro/Valigi (2021), we use an online real estate platform
  as an example to illustrate how machine learning can work.

  The core business problem is matching sellers and buyers. The core
  value is the house price. We want to build a machine learning (ML)
  model that predicts house prices based on real estate market data.

  When a new house comes on the market, we want the AI to predict a
  price based on other comparable houses. The AI computes a similarity
  measure.

** Data

   Both features and labels are variables. Features are
   given/independent, and labels are targets/dependent. The label
   variables are what we want to predict.

   The available data is split into training and test sets. The
   training data is used to make the model learn, and the test data is
   used to test the model on unknown data, simulating the real-world
   application.
   
** Programming

   How does this kind of program relate to traditional rule-based
   programming?

** Concepts

   | ML algorithm ("the AI") | Allows computers to learn from data                                  |
   | Features                | Model input, characteristics of an object that the AI can learn from |
   | Label                   | Model output or target we want the AI to predict                     |
   | Training                | Phase when the AI is fed with past features to learn patterns        |
   | Model                   | Output of the training phase, capable of making predictions          |
   | Inference               | Phase in which the model is used with new examples                   |
   | Training data           |                                                                      |
   | Test data               |                                                                      |

** Discussion

   * How does machine learning relate to the "intelligent agents"
     concept?
   * What do you think are the advantages and disadvantages of this
     approach?
