* ML basics

  Following Mauro/Valigi (2021), we use an online real estate platform
  as an example to illustrate how machine learning can work.

  The core business problem is matching sellers and buyers. The core
  value is the house price. We want to build a machine learning (ML)
  model that predicts house prices based on real estate market data.

  When a new house comes on the market, we want the AI to predict a
  price based on other comparable houses. The AI computes a similarity
  measure.

** Problem

   The machine learning problem - predict the best price for homes
   listed on a real estate platform. /Image: purchasing process./

   /Which other *problems* suited for ML do you know?/[fn:1]
   
** Process

   /Is this an *agile* process? Why or why not?/

** Data

   Though the availability of data ("Big Data") drives much of the ML
   development, the basic data format and the way the data are used to
   establish ML models, are well known and have long been in use.
   
*** Data format   
    Image: Table with features and labels for several examples.

    #+attr_html: :width 600px
    [[./img/data.png]]

    Both features and labels are variables. Features are
    given/independent, and labels are targets/dependent. The label
    variables are what we want to predict.

*** Data use

     The available data is split into training and test sets. The
     training data is used to make the model learn, and the test data is
     used to test the model on unknown data, simulating the real-world
     application.
   
** Programming

   How does this kind of program relate to traditional rule-based
   programming?

** Concepts

   | ML algorithm ("the AI") | Allows computers to learn from data                                  |
   | Features                | Model input, characteristics of an object that the AI can learn from |
   | Label                   | Model output or target we want the AI to predict                     |
   | Training                | Phase when the AI is fed with past features to learn patterns        |
   | Model                   | Output of the training phase, capable of making predictions          |
   | Inference               | Phase in which the model is used with new examples                   |
   | Training data           | Data used to create the model ("learning")                           |
   | Test data               | Data used to apply the model ("production")                          |

** Discussion

   * How does machine learning relate to the "intelligent agents"
     concept?
   * What do you think are the advantages and disadvantages of this
     approach?
   * Do you recognize these concepts in your own AI application
     (solo presentation or team project)? Does ML play a role here?
     Which one?
