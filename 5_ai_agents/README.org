  AIMA: agent-world vs. environment view

  Modified process modeling view (BPMN diagram):

** Rational agent success

   Success of a rational agent in this simple picture depends on:

  1) the performance measure that defines success
  2) the agent's knowledge of the environment
  3) the actions that the agent can perform
  4) the agent's percept sequence to date

** Example: Vacuum-cleaner

   The microworld of the vacuum cleaner has a known boundary, and it
   is divided in subspaces that the agent can navigate. In each
   subspace, there is an unspecified amount of dirt. The overall
   mission is to clean the space.

   | ASPECT      | EXAMPLE             |   |
   |-------------+---------------------+---|
   | Performance | Award cleanliness   |   |
   | Environment | Spatial dimensions  |   |
   | Actions     | Movements + sucking |   |
   | Perceptions | Location + dirt     |   |

   Can such a simple agent behave irrationally, too?

**  Definition of a rational agent

   #+begin_quote
   For each possible percept sequence, a rational agent should select
   an action that is expected to maximize its performance measure,
   given the evidence provided by the percept sequence and whatever
   built-in knowledge the agent has.
