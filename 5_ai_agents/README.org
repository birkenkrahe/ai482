* Agents and environments

  The purpose of this section is to bridge the gap between AI ideas
  and practice. To do this, we adopt the rational agent approach
  promoted in [[aima][AIMA]], and implemented in day-to-day AI systems, like
  robot vacuum cleaners that operate in the real world, or
  personalized shopping apps that operate in virtual commercial space.

  The abstract insights about rational agents are useful as an
  analytic framework, much like the distinction between supervised and
  unsupervised learning that we will look at next.

  These lecture notes corresponds to some of the chapter 2 content of
  the textbook ([[aima][Russell/Norvig]], 2021).

** Microworld-view

   The diagram shows a world- or space-oriented view of an agent and
   its environment. The microworld view is less intuitive than the
   process-view[fn:1] - think about your learning as a student: you
   don't dwell on the fact that you move from your personal into
   classroom space - and it would be difficult to see how to optimize
   this spatial movement (for learning). Instead, you operate - like
   an agent - with process steps (go to class, listen to lecture, do
   exercise, take notes etc.). It is easier to think of input and
   output and optimizing functions when following a process[fn:2].

** Rational agent success

   Success of a rational agent in this simple picture depends on:

   1) the performance measure that defines success
   2) the agent's knowledge of the environment
   3) the actions that the agent can perform
   4) the agent's percept sequence to date

** Example: robotic vacuum-cleaner

   The microworld of the vacuum cleaner has a known boundary, and it
   is divided in subspaces that the agent can navigate. In each
   subspace, there is an unspecified amount of dirt. The overall
   mission is to clean the space.

   [[./img/vacuum.png]]

   | ASPECT      | EXAMPLE             | FUNCTIONS |
   |-------------+---------------------+-----------|
   | Performance | Award cleanliness   | Maximize  |
   | Environment | Spatial dimensions  | Minimize  |
   | Actions     | Movements + sucking | Table     |
   | Perceptions | Location + dirt     | Table     |

   Can such a simple agent behave irrationally, too?[fn:3]

   It is worth noting that irrational behavior in humans can lead to
   unforeseen (and unforeseeable) innovations and optimizations, but
   also, of course, to destructive behavior. In fact, one could argue
   that controlled irrationality is the core of creative behavior and
   originality.

** Definition of a rational agent

   #+begin_quote
   "For each possible percept sequence, a rational agent should select
   an action that is expected to maximize its performance measure,
   given the evidence provided by the percept sequence and whatever
   built-in knowledge the agent has." ([[aima][AIMA]])
   #+end_quote

** Process view

   The definition suggests a process-oriented description of the
   behavior of a rational agent. Such a process is shown in the BPMN
   diagram below.

   [[./img/agents_and_environments.png]]

* Task environments

  The greatest challenge for the agent is operating in a given
  environment. To design agents that can manage this challenge, we
  classify different types of environments.

** Current research

   Recent article: "Solving the Robot Off-Loading Problem": helping
   robots choose when to communicate with the cloud without latency or
   lost data issues ([[myers][Myers, 2021]]).

   [[./img/drone.jpg]]

** Remote Mars rover navigation

   In 2015, the then-VP of the German software giant SAP demonstrated
   remote control of a Mars rover during an SAP developers conference
   presentation - using the 2015 feature film "The Martian" as a
   prompt.

   Since the presentation is quite long, I cut it into 7 different
   parts and put it into [[https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6SfZh1-kWXnWedFzgEwt6R6zhjdBxJsT][this playlist]] for classroom use. The demo
   uses every software layer indicated in the diagram below. And
   rather than only talk about stuff, the presenter shows how it is
   done and how all these different systems work together.

   Of course, the talk is steeped in technical and commercial language
   that you will not understand - but hopefully, with my comments
   (below each video) and the glossary below, you'll be able to follow
   the story. Enjoy!


   [[./img/sap.png]]

   Image explanation: SAP system architecture on premise (local, at
   the company) vs. cloud (non-local, at a server center) - this is
   the so-called SAAS (Software As A Service) business model. "HANA"
   refers to a database technology. "SAP ERP" and "S4/HANA" are
   information systems that support the entire company value chain -
   from production to customer delivery. These are the largest
   available information systems, and SAP is the leading provider of
   such systems. In fact, it'll be difficult to find a large company
   anywhere that does not run its processes using SAP. The "cloud
   platform" contains all sorts of new services, some of them
   AI-driven, like "Analytics" and "Internet of Things".

** PEAS example: automated taxi driver

   PEAS description for an automated taxi driver (transport agent):

   | PERFORMANCE MEASURE                                      | ENVIRONMENT                                             | ACTUATORS                                                   | SENSORS                                                                         |

   | Safe, fast, legal, comfy trip, max profits, min accident | Roads, traffic, police, pedestrians, customers, weather | Steering, accelerator, brake, signal, horn, display, speech | Camera, radar, GPS, speedometer, engine, accelerometer, microphone, touchscreen |

   #+begin_quote
   "Virtual task environments (not in the physical world) can be as
   complex as real ones." ([[aima][AIMA]])
   #+end_quote

   *What do you think:* are AUGMENTED reality environments more, less,
   or equally complex?[fn:5]

** PEAS Challenge

   Identify PEAS elements for each of these agent types!

   * Medical diagnosis system
   * Satellite image analysis system
   * Part-picking robot
   * Refinery controller
   * Interactive English tutor

     [[[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/blob/main/5_ai_agents/img/challenge.png][Solution]], [[aima][AIMA]] table 2.5]

   All of these applications are present today in their respective
   industrial environments - health care, weather forecasting,
   factories, processing plants, and online learning platforms.

   Notice how when you think about actuators and sensors, you might
   automatically think of humanoid robots. However, the most efficient
   solution need not be humanoid (using human behavior, or physiology
   as a design blueprint) - except when humans are directly involved
   (health care, tutoring).

** Task environment properties

   The following properties is a taxonomy akin to a classification of
   insects or plants in nature: like these, the properties of agents
   refer to an evolving ecology. Also, they are used to explore and,
   in a way, define machine "intelligence".

   | PROPERTY          | OPTIONS                                              |
   |-------------------+------------------------------------------------------|
   | 1) Observability  | Fully, partially or unobservable[fn:6]               |
   | 2) Multiplicity   | single or multi-agent                                |
   | 3) Performativity | competitive or cooperative                           |
   | 4) Determinacy    | deterministic, non-deterministic or stochastic[fn:7] |
   | 5) Causality      | sequential or episodic                               |
   | 6) Stativity      | static or dynamic or semidynamic (score[fn:8])             |
   | 7) Temporality    | Discrete or continuous (state/time)                  |
   | 8) Physicality    | Known or unknown (laws)                              |
   | 9) Virtuality     | Virtual or real                                      |
   | 10) Locality      | Local or non-local                                   |

** Environment of the automated taxi driver
   Let's look at the automated taxi driver as an example:

   1) *Observability:* The environment is partially observable - for
      example, the agent cannot observe (or even find out directly)
      what other drivers are thinking.
   2) *Multiplicity:* The agent could treat another vehicle as an
      object or as an agent, too. Which relationship it is depends on
      the design of both vehicles involved: are any messages exchanged
      between them, or are there decisions where one agent's actions
      depend on the other? For example, if the taxi agent has a sensor
      that is directly fed data from the other vehicle, they'd form a
      two-agent system whose actions depend on one another.
   3) *Performativity:* this applies only to multi-agent systems. The
      taxi environment is both cooperative (with other non-taxi
      vehicles), and competitive (with other taxi drivers).
   4) *Determinacy:* the taxi environment is non-deterministic since
      the behavior of traffic cannot be predicted with
      certainty. Certain aspects (e.g. traffic density, weather
      conditions etc.) are stochastic and can be predicted with
      quantities attached to them ("10% probability of rain during
      this trip").
   5) *Causality:* short term, episodic actions, have long-term
      consequences for the taxi agent - the agent has to think ahead
      based on the past driving history and its past actions. For
      example, when it suddenly begins to rain, it has to adjust its
      breaking behavior.
   6) *Stativity:* the driving environment changes continuously,
      requiring agent responses ("The street is wet, what do you want
      to do?") and adjustments.
   7) *Temporality:* taxi driving is a continous state and a continous
      time problem - speed and location of the taxi change all the
      time, and they change smoothly, not abruptly. Driving actions
      are also continuous. Sensor input itself is discrete (digital
      signals) but is treated as continuous (distributions are
      smoothed).
   8) *Physicality:* some of the environment is unknown e.g. when the
      journey starts. This means that the taxi driver needs to learn
      properties of its environment that cannot be hard-coded at the
      start of the journey.
   9) *Virtuality:* the automated taxi driver has both a virtual
      (testing and simulation) environment and a real
      environment. Performance, actuation and sensing are relevant for
      both environments but only the real environment is productive.
   10) *Locality:* the taxi driver deals with both local and non-local
       data, e.g. construction sites along the road are non-local,
       while road signs encountered during the drive are local. For
       the performance, local data are more relevant.

   #+begin_quote
   "The hardest [agent task environment] case is partially observable,
   multiagent, nondeterministic, sequential, dynamic, continous, and
   unknown."  ([[aima][AIMA]])
   #+end_quote

   Here are examples for some of these categories.

** Systemic interpretation

   These properties define the agent as a system with a boundary
   between itself and the environment, with elements (actuators,
   sensors), and relationships between these elements. This means that
   the properties are not limited to AI systems - you could use them
   to describe other cybernetic systems, like heating systems.

** Homework

   Pick any of the online exercises for this chapter of [[aima][AIMA]] (ch. 2)
   and work out a solution, or sketch a path towards a solution
   (e.g. by describing what one might do, in which order), or sketch
   specific problems and issues for discussion, and present in class
   (for: Friday October 1).

   Several of the exercises (from ex. 7) relate to material that we
   have not covered yet (structure of agent programs and types of
   agents), but we will have, before fall break. I think it might be
   cool to continue working on some of these exercises for the
   remainder of the term. You can also easily turn them into
   presentations.

** Simple reflex agents[fn:9]

   Requires: condition-action rules

   Example: vacuum robot (smart home).

   [[./img/simple.png]]

** Model based agents

   Requires: model on how the agent's world evolves

   Example: portfolio agent (stock market).

   [[./img/model.png]]

** Goal based agents

   Requires: explicit goal-checking

   [[./img/goal.png]]

** Utility based agents

   Requires: utility function.

   [[./img/utility.png]]

** Learning agents

   Requires: modifies own functions

   [[./img/learning.png]]

** All types

   [[./img/all_types.png]]

** Other classifications

   There are, of course, other classifications. Here is another,
   widely cited one, by [[delaurentis][DeLaurentis (2005)]]. In this model, simple
   reflex ("reactive"), utility and goal-based agents are labelled as
   having "a set solution path" (i.e. a rule set). In fact, this
   taxonomy is vulnerable: the relationships of the new five
   categories suggested by this author are not obviously logically
   related. Remember: if the logic of a taxonomy, a classification
   scheme, is not obvious and can be tested, it is (almost) worthless,
   because you cannot use it to place things uniquely into categories
   (which is the only point of having a taxonomy in the first place).

** Briefing: DIY

   You find the briefing below. For my part, I have looked through the
   exercises and sketched thoughts, extensions and issues with some of
   these. Over to you...

   #+begin_quote
   With the 4th edition (2021), the exercises for AIMA are online
   only, open for submissions from everyone. I thought it might be fun
   to see if we can contribute to the world-wide effort to understand
   AI and where it's going. So here's the idea:

   Your job:

   Pick one of more of the AIMA online exercises for chapter 2,
   "Intelligent Agents".  Work out a solution, or sketch a solution
   path, or list issues that you can see for answering any of these
   exercises.  Present your findings (informally or formally) on
   Friday, October 1, in our last session before the fall break.
   #+end_quote

** Relationship between evolution and ...

   The difficulty for me with this exercise is that evolution is
   empirically challenged: it is not directly observable, and hence
   evolutionary claims and hypothesis cannot be verified
   experimentally. In fact, evolution is continously undergoing
   paradigmatic changes (cp. [[evolution][Pigliucci, 2009]]).

   My personal doubt of evolutionary theory is anchored in its
   inability to explain the origin of language (cp. [[wolfe][Wolfe, 2016]]).

** Syllogisms

   The many assertions of exercise 4 are very interesting: this is an
   excellent opportunity to check one's grasp on logic. AIMA makes
   certain assumptions and provides definitions, and you need to check
   if these assertions follow or not.

** PEAS
   
   We did something like exercise 5 and 6 in class: giving a PEAS
   description of various tasks. This is a great exercise to build a
   checklist of automated or automatable activities surrounding daily
   activities. You can then proceed to check if any of these already
   have agents supporting them or not. And if not, you might have
   found a niche!

** Glossary

   Exercise 7 is a glossary exercise: I have repeatedly shown you how
   and why I think it is really important to have short definitions
   ready - it demonstrates your understanding and enables you to move
   on through papers, discussions, etc.

** Coding

   If I find the time (not this term, I am afraid), I will have a look
   at the GitHub code repo for AIMA. Or perhaps one of you wants to
   present and explain some of the code - e.g. for an application like
   the simple utility agent "vacuum cleaner".

** Hardware
   
   Not an answer but another question that I have because most of the
   discussion in AIMA (apart from the last couple of chapters) is
   about software. What is actually involved in building a real robot?

   I have a great book reference: [[baumik][Bhaumik, 2018]]. Perhaps a basis for a
   future special course at Lyon? Or for a summer school project?

[fn:9]IMHO, these illustrations are not very clear and should be
replaced by proper modeling diagrams in BPMN or UML (use case
diagrams). This will be an assignment for the parallel "data modeling"
class!

[fn:8]In a semidynamic environment, the enviroment itself does not
change but a performance score does - chess with a clock is an
example: when the clock is ticking, the performance time changes even
though the board is static.

[fn:7]AIMA distinguishes between non-deterministic (aka uncertain) and
stochastic (aka uncertain but with a quantifiable probability).

[fn:6]"Unobservable" in principle means that the agent has no sensors
in all task environments (it must have some data otherwise it could
not perform its optimization strategy).

[fn:5]The answer depends on the measure of "complexity". For the sake
of argument, one could assume the complexity of the real world to be
"1", and of a completely static virtual world "0". Alternatively, you
have to use a complexity measure that can be quantified and
e.g. implemented in a program like Dörner's in "The logic of failure"
([[dorner][Dörner, 1990]]).

[fn:4]1-3 came from course participants (see [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cVty0VxQ2pU99cOk8LD-rJPsOi0pOm7Z?usp=sharing][whiteboard, Sept 20]]), 4-7
are my personal opinion. "Automatic writing" includes AI-driven
spell-checking apps like Grammarly (beware - cp. [[bee][Bee 2021]], though the
[[https://www.grammarly.com/blog/engineering/][Grammarly engineering blog]] is quite interesting). Quote from a video
demonstrating jarvis.ai ([[reed][Reed Floren, 2021]]): "I've created a 1000 word
article in minutes on a topic that I really know nothing about."

[fn:3]The answer is yes: whenever the maximizing or minimizing
functions are not executed well, e.g. because of lack of environmental
knowledge, or because the performance measure is ill-defined, or
because of faulty sensor data. In the case of the Rumba: not moving
(action), or not sucking (action), not respecting the boundaries
(environment), stopping short of cleaning well because of faulty
rewarding (performance), etc.

[fn:2]You could also look at the job of learning in terms of incoming
or outgoing data, or different data formats. This would be closer to
computer processing and further from the human experience.

[fn:1]Much like in probability: these are usually introduced via state
spaces (e.g. the different combinations when rolling a dice). A better
way of thinking about probability is as a process of creating one
record after another - essentially an event log of stochastic
events. Cp. [[matloff][Matloff (2020)]].
