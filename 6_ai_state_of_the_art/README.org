* Machine learning
  After looking at the [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/tree/main/4_ai_history][history of AI]], and some of the foundations of a
  dominant AI methodology ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/tree/main/5_ai_agents][intelligent agents]]), we need to take stock
  of what AI actually achieves today, and why it's such a hot
  topic. It turns out that most of the running AI applications
  ("production AI") is related to machine learning (ML), i.e. learning
  agents, especially supervised learning - recognizing (= classifying)
  known patterns learnt from big data samples. Ng's first definition
  of ML is Samuel's seminal 1959 definition ([[ng18][stanfordonline,
  2020]])[fn:1]:

* AI research-to-production gap

  In this video AI researcher Andrew Ng addresses three issues to
  explain why ML is not more successful in the real world ([[ng][Stanford
  HAI, 2020]]). Many academic research results are spectacular, but in
  real settings, e.g. hospitals, you don't find AI (except in
  embedded, i.e. invisible systems like cameras, sensors etc.).

  For details, see student session protocols. Here you find only
  technical glossary additions and stuff that was left out of the
  protocols.

  [[https://youtu.be/tsPuVAMaADY?t=547][Right at the start]], he gives a list of supervised learning tasks
  that have successfully been addressed by machines.

** Small data

   Examples for [[https://youtu.be/tsPuVAMaADY?t=1054][small data algorithms]] include GANs and GPT-3.

   GANs stands for Generative Adversarial Network (cp. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network][Wikipedia]]),
   which is a game theoretical ML application where two neural
   networks learn by competing with each other. Originated in 2014.

   GPT-3 is the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (cp. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3][Wikipedia]])
   used especially in natural language processing (NLP), e.g. to
   simulate human language. Originated in 2020.

* Footnotes

[fn:1]In the same lecture, Ng relates another, more recent definition
of the kind of problem that ML addresses, called a "well-posed problem":
#+begin_quote
A computer is said to /learn/ from experience E with respect to some
task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as
measured by P, improves with experience E.
#+end_quote
In the language of our last lesson, E is the precept, and T could be
any task, no matter how complex, as long as we can define a P.
