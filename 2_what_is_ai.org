   * Should we focus on humans?
   * Should we focus on machines?

** Four approaches

   |             | THOUGHT / LOGIC          | BEHAVIOR / ACTION     |
   |-------------+--------------------------+-----------------------|
   | *HUMANITY*  | /Cognitive modeling/     | /Turing Test/         |
   | *RATIONALITY* | /Laws of Thought/        | /Rational Agents/     |

*** Acting humanly ("Turing test" approach)

    * Natural language processing
    * Knowledge representation
    * Automated reasoning
    * Machine learning
    * Computer vision
    * Robotics

*** Thinking humanly ("cognitive modeling" approach)

    * Introspection
    * Psychological experiments
    * Brain imaging
    * Cognitive science
    * Algorithms

*** Thinking rationally ("laws of thought" approach)

    * Syllogistic reasoning
    * Logic
    * Expert systems
    * Uncertainty
    * Probability

*** Acting rationally ("rational agent" approach)

    * Combination approach
    * Constructivist
    * Doing the right thing
    * Standard model
    * Control theory

* Major issues

   #+attr_html: :height 200px

  * Bounded Rationality
  * Value alignment problem

** Bounded rationality
