* What is this?

  A place for irregular articles of possible interest to students of
  the DSC 482.01 course, a special seminar on "Artificial
  Intelligence", mostly to avoid lengthy emails and to park content
  that I may want to develop later on, if I find the time.

* Friday, August 27 - Buns & Books

** At the Salty Dog

   After class today, I went over to the Salty Dog to treat myself to a
   much-deserved cappuccino + cinnamon bun. This combo is excellent and
   did much to improve my mood (which had already been good anyway).

** At the Library

   Once the bun had been handed over to my abdomen, I headed to the
   library to drink my coffee: the armchairs near the entrance are
   fantastic[fn:1]. Since I was in a library, I put my phone away and
   picked up a magazine. Guess what I found? An really interesting
   article on AI: "Bot Doc", on a miniature surgical robot
   ([[feldman21][Feldman/Pratap, 2021]]). [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pi3qw5vlkWoChkLqOwOTXOewcGJ2hXrc?usp=sharing][I took pictures]] but, of course, to have the
   full experience, you should go to the library! This is an example
   for a new AI application that you could feature in a presentation
   and/or for your own AI application project[fn:3].

** AI Books

   You should do that in any case: they have a great collection of
   books on AI. I really don't know why! The books are mostly dated,
   but that does not matter so much. I borrowed two, which are
   relevant to the next few weeks - "AI - A Philosophical
   Introduction" ([[copeland1993][Copeland, 1993]]), by a professor of logic (now you
   know in which quadrant of the graph we are, right?), and "Computers
   and Thought" ([[feigenbaum63][Feigenbaum/Feldman eds., 1963]]).

   I had only been aware of one book on the philosophy of AI, by
   H.L. Dreyfus, "What Computers Still Can't Do" ([[dreyfus1992][1992]]), a pessimistic
   account of the progress of AI since its beginnings. Here is a
   conversation with Dreyfus on "why machines cannot become human."
   ([[dreyfus2008][UCTV, 2008]])[fn:2]:

   #+begin_quote
   "At a time when researchers were proposing grand plans for general
   problem solvers and automatic translation machines, Dreyfus
   predicted that they would fail because their conception of mental
   functioning was naive, and he suggested that they would do well to
   acquaint themselves with modern philosophical approaches to human
   beings. What Computers Can't Do was widely attacked but quietly
   studied. Dreyfus's arguments are still provocative and focus our
   attention once again on what it is that makes human beings unique."
   ([[https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/what-computers-still-cant-do][mitpress.edu]])
   #+end_quote

   "Computers and Thought" is a scientific monograph with articles by
   some of the greats of the field - Turing (the article I already
   recommended to you, from 1947), Simon, Newell (both creators of the
   "General Problem-solver", another AI attempt in the logic quadrant
   of our graph):

   #+begin_quote
   "Computers and Thought showcases the work of the scientists who not
   only defined the field of artificial intelligence, but who are
   responsible for having developed it into what it is
   today. Originally published in 1963, this collection includes
   twenty classic papers by such pioneers as A. M. Turing and Marvin
   Minsky who were behind the pivotal advances in artificially
   simulating human thought processes with computers. Among the now
   hard-to-find articles are reports of computer programs that play
   chess and checkers, prove theorems in logic and geometry, solve
   problems in calculus, balance assembly lines, recognize visual
   temporal patterns, and communicate in natural language. The reports
   of simulation of cognitive processes include computer models of
   human behavior in logic problems, deciding on common stock
   portfolios, and carrying out social interaction. Models of verbal
   learning behavior, predictive behavior in two-choice experiments,
   and concept formation are also included." ([[https://www.aaai.org/Press/Books/feigenbaum.php][aaai.org]])

   I'll dive into these over the weekend when I prepare my upcoming
   lectures.

* Monday, September 27 - Deep Learning

  A month after the last entry, the AI seminar has somwehat matured:
  we've talked about what AI is (and is not), covered some of the
  interesting history of AI, looked at the intelligent agent paradigm,
  and entered the realm of currently interesting questions (mostly
  related to deep learning, a form of machine learning).

  As a result of my own immersion into the topic, I come across a lot
  of sources some of which are too important not to be passed on, but
  class time is so limited that I'd rather do it via diary for those
  engaged enough to follow up.

** History of AI

   The history of AI is interesting on different levels:
   philosophically (history of ideas), practically (consequences), and
   scientifically (research). As I pointed out in class, STEM fields
   often disregard their history or stash it away to gather dust, as
   the plaything of historians and librarians. The reason: these fields
   move so fast that there doesn't seem to be time to look
   back. Disregarding one's history can incur research burden -
   sometimes, results already known have to be rediscovered - and not
   crediting first researchers is a form of fraud, too. I became aware
   of this for Deep Learning (the topic that Andrew Ng is wrestling
   with in his video) via this recent [[https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/scientific-integrity-turing-award-deep-learning.html][blog post]] by Schmidhuber
   ([[fraud][2021]]). Himself an expert, he documents how the recipients of the
   2018 Turing Award (for progress in deep learning), all three of them
   giants in their field, were standing on the shoulders of earlier
   giants whom they apparently failed to mention.

   From my time as a particle physicist, I am aware of similar issues
   of intellectual integrity. Often, these occurred because particle
   physics is such an old discipline, by comparison with computer
   science, or data science and AI[fn:4], hence memory loss is
   systemically induced. Deep Learning does not really have temporal
   excuses.


** State of the Art of AI

   I'm using Andrew Ng's video lecture for [[ng][Stanford HAI (2020)]] as a
   source for discussion and presentation. Ng is an important
   influencer in this space. His company [[https://www.deeplearning.ai/][DeepLearning.ai]] is focused on
   educating large audiences (he is one of the founders of Coursera).

   I rather like his style and presentation though of course he is
   himself an AI stakeholder and not an independent, impartial
   observer (bias!). However, he also seems to be a good scientist,
   with integrity and an ability to see his own achievements in the
   cold light of truth.

   I think the class is a representative sample of the general
   population and its (positive and negative) prejudices against AI. I
   think just by observing our class dialog one might learn a lot
   about how to increase AI literacy in society and in organizations.

   Ng focuses on health care examples - this is a major future battle
   ground and I recommend listening to this panel discussion between
   three AI and healthcare experts ([[feifei][stanfordonline, 2021]]) to get a
   better idea of the challenges and opportunities.

   As I said in the lecture, AI is already around us, and often
   embedded in our systems to a much greater extent than many
   assume. I plan to use some of my research money in 2022 to
   introduce "[[https://www.arducam.com/raspberry-pi-pico-tensorflow-lite-micro-person-detection-arducam/][TinyML]]" - machine learning with embedded devices and
   micro controllers - to Lyon, since this interests me from a
   research point of view, and is also fairly easy to do, affordable
   and fun.

* Monday, October 25 - Snapshot
** Curiosity
  The AI seminar is picking up speed. There is still so much to talk
  and learn about, but between my short lectures and the students'
  presentations, I think we'll be able to cover a fair amount of
  current AI developments. Enough anyway for the students to go off
  and satisfy their curiosity on their own.

  The first three student solo presentations were very encouraging!
  They were certainly as good as anything that I ever presented to
  this class.
** Champions
  When I saw this list ([[neurapod][Neura Pod-Neuralink, 2021]]) of AI champions, I
  was wondering how many of them believed in the principal uniqueness
  of humans (e.g. because they are Christians). What do you think?

  #+attr_html: :width 600px
  [[./img/champions.png]]

  On this list, Russell is a co-author of AIMA, Andrew Ng is known to
  you from a video we watched in class, Larry Page created a
  successful document search and retrieval algorithm (and founded
  Google), and Bill Gates is (indirectly) responsible for your OS.
** China

   Scary stuff in this German documentary (by "Deutsche Welle", which
   is Germany's BBC World) - use of surveillance technology and AI in
   China today and tomorrow.

* Footnotes

[fn:4]The systematic study of particles goes back ca. 2,500 years to
the Greek natural philosophers like Democritus.

[fn:3]The article contains a few medical terms that I did not know,
like "bariatric surgeon" and "laparoscopy". So much for having studied
Latin and Greek, I suppose. Where are the words when you need them?

[fn:2]The 1992 book is an update of the classic "What Computers Can't
Do" ([[dreyfus72][1972]]), which was the earliest philosophical attack on AI (not
without pushback, cp. [[buch][Buchanan, 1972]]). Twenty years later, the author
remained unrelenting in his critique of AI. Dreyfus and I share a love
for the religious philosopher Soren Kierkegaard, and an awe of the
German phenomenologist Heidegger. Dreyfus' YouTube lectures on these
guys are pretty fascinating.

[fn:1]In fact, a student had fallen asleep on a couch. He was cradling
his laptop. After a few minutes, he got up with the words: "I fell
asleep. What a bad idea." It reminded me of a visit in Paris when I
was 19 or so: there's a famous bookshop, Shakespeare's & Co, across
from the church Notre Dame. I used to go there late at night. The
upper stories had velvet-covered chaise longues. Once, after having
walked around in Paris for hours and hours, I was tired like a dog,
fell asleep on one of those couches, and awoke only on the next
morning: evidently, they had found me and let me sleep there.
