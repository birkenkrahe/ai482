* What is this?

  A place for irregular articles of possible interest to students of
  the DSC 482.01 course, a special seminar on "Artificial
  Intelligence", mostly to avoid lengthy emails and to park content
  that I may want to develop later on, if I find the time.

* Friday, August 27 - Books and Games

** At the Salty Dog

   After class today, I went over to the Salty Dog to treat myself to a
   much-deserved cappuccino + cinnamon bun. This combo is excellent and
   did much to improve my mood (which had already been good anyway).

** At the Library

   Once the bun had been handed over to my abdomen, I headed to the
   library to drink my coffee: the armchairs near the entrance are
   fantastic[fn:1]. Since I was in a library, I put my phone away and
   picked up a magazine. Guess what I found? An really interesting
   article on AI: "Bot Doc", on a miniature surgical robot
   ([[feldman21][Feldman/Pratap, 2021]]). [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pi3qw5vlkWoChkLqOwOTXOewcGJ2hXrc?usp=sharing][I took pictures]] but, of course, to have the
   full experience, you should go to the library! This is an example
   for a new AI application that you could feature in a presentation
   and/or for your own AI application project[fn:3].

** AI Books

   You should do that in any case: they have a great collection of
   books on AI. I really don't know why! The books are mostly dated,
   but that does not matter so much. I borrowed two, which are
   relevant to the next few weeks - "AI - A Philosophical
   Introduction" ([[copeland1993][Copeland, 1993]]), by a professor of logic (now you
   know in which quadrant of the graph we are, right?), and "Computers
   and Thought" ([[feigenbaum63][Feigenbaum/Feldman eds., 1963]]).

   I had only been aware of one book on the philosophy of AI, by
   H.L. Dreyfus, "What Computers Still Can't Do" ([[dreyfus1992][1992]]), a pessimistic
   account of the progress of AI since its beginnings. Here is a
   conversation with Dreyfus on "why machines cannot become human."
   ([[dreyfus2008][UCTV, 2008]])[fn:2].

   "Computers and Thought" is a scientific monograph with articles by
   some of the greats of the field - Turing (the article I already
   recommended to you, from 1947), Simon, Newell (both creators of the
   "General Problem-solver", another AI attempt in the logic quadrant
   of our graph):

   #+begin_quote
   "Computers and Thought showcases the work of the scientists who not
   only defined the field of artificial intelligence, but who are
   responsible for having developed it into what it is
   today. Originally published in 1963, this collection includes
   twenty classic papers by such pioneers as A. M. Turing and Marvin
   Minsky who were behind the pivotal advances in artificially
   simulating human thought processes with computers. Among the now
   hard-to-find articles are reports of computer programs that play
   chess and checkers, prove theorems in logic and geometry, solve
   problems in calculus, balance assembly lines, recognize visual
   temporal patterns, and communicate in natural language. The reports
   of simulation of cognitive processes include computer models of
   human behavior in logic problems, deciding on common stock
   portfolios, and carrying out social interaction. Models of verbal
   learning behavior, predictive behavior in two-choice experiments,
   and concept formation are also included." ([[https://www.aaai.org/Press/Books/feigenbaum.php][aaai.org]])

   I'll dive into these over the weekend when I prepare my upcoming
   lectures.

** Games industry in Arkansas?

   I had a nice conversation with an internship student, who turned
   out to like similar video games like I - the Dark Souls series, and
   other titles. From what she told me, there may be quite a pool of
   students at Lyon interested in video games. I'm inspired to think
   about ways in which one could use this talent for a gaming industry
   startup. This could be fun, and it could potentially be great for
   Lyon and for Batesville. There already is a thriving esports
   program at the college, and this might fit right in. Also: I need
   to get my hands on a PS5!

** Community

   On a losely related note: I got my Arkansas drivers license today!
   Beginning to feel like a full member of this community. Also: very
   impressed with the administrative processes all around. Getting
   your license in Germany is a major headache. Weeks later, they send
   it to you via surface mail. In Batesville, you present your
   documents, do a visual test, and minutes later you walk out, a
   freshly printed license and full ID in hand. It's a little like
   moving from a Kafka novel into a story where suddenly everything
   makes a little more sense.

* Footnotes

[fn:3]The article contains a few medical terms that I did not know,
like "bariatric surgeon" and "laparoscopy". So much for having studied
Latin and Greek, I suppose. Where are the words when you need them?

[fn:2]The 1992 book is an update of the classic "What Computers Can't
Do" ([[dreyfus72][1972]]), which was the earliest philosophical attack on AI. Twenty years
later, the author remained unrelenting in his critique of AI. Dreyfus
and I share a love for the religious philosopher Soren Kierkegaard,
and an awe of the German phenomenologist Heidegger. Dreyfus' YouTube
lectures on these guys are pretty fascinating.

[fn:1]In fact, a student had fallen asleep on a couch. He was cradling
his laptop. After a few minutes, he got up with the words: "I fell
asleep. What a bad idea." It reminded me of a visit in Paris when I
was 19 or so: there's a famous bookshop, Shakespeare's & Co, across
from the church Notre Dame. I used to go there late at night. The
upper stories had velvet-covered chaise longues. Once, after having
walked around in Paris for hours and hours, I was tired like a dog,
fell asleep on one of those couches, and awoke only on the next
morning: evidently, they had found me and let me sleep there.
