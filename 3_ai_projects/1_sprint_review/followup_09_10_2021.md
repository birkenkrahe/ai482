**** Viktor/Harry - IMDB vs Rottentomatoes film reviews

**** Payne - Exploring Pokemon data

**** William - Where does the DoD money go?


** Submit ideas for your EDA project (7 Sep)

   Submit your ideas for a team EDA project here as a comment on this
   post by Thursday, September 9, 12 PM. We discussed several example
   projects (see [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsc101/blob/main/1_overview/1_overview.md#org38b7223][course overview]]).

   Put the tentative *title* of your EDA project (or more than one, if
   there are several you're thinking about) into the subject line.  In
   the body of your post, put *references* and *thoughts* (e.g. why
   you want to present this topic - what motivates you), or *concerns*
   (e.g. difficulties that you expect).  References (literature,
   sites, blogs, personal communications etc.) are most important if
   you have them, because they help to validate your choice.

   Your topic should have DATA available, it should be DOABLE (not too
   big, not requiring expertise you don't have), you should ideally
   have some DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE (i.e. use what you already know or have
   learnt), and you should be MOTIVATED to do the research.

   You'll briefly present your topic based on this information in
   class, followed by a short discussion. For this first sprint
   review, you don't have to follow the usual rules ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.md#org4966486][see FAQ]]) yet.

** Test 4 (Week 5)

*** What does "GNU" stand for (in computer science)?

    (1) A large suite of free software tools (+)

    (2) GNU's Not Unix (+)

    (3) Geeky Nerd User

    (4) Free software operating system (+)

    (5) The organization behind the extensible Emacs editor (+)

    (6) The organization behind the C/C++ compiler gcc (+)

** Test 3 (Week 4 / 7 September)

   This is the second of our series of weekly tests (15% of your final
   grade). You have an unlimited number of attempts. I have added
   feedback to the answers where this might be useful. The tests will
   also form the content of the final exam.

*** Which of these are advantages of R over Python?

    (1) R is easier to learn (+)

    Sounds subjective but there are some deeper reasons behind this
    answer, which you may appreciate more if you try to learn
    Python. If you already know Python and strongly disagree, let me
    know!

    (2) R is more interactive

    Nope. Python also has an interactive shell. In R, interactive
    shell mode is more common though (for quick data analysis and
    visualization)

    (3) R is more useful for general-purpose programming

    Nope. It's the other way around: for general purpose programming
    tasks, e.g. automation, system scripts etc., Python is to be
    preferred. These are less relevant for data science though (except
    for the data wrangling stage perhaps).

    (4) Visualization is fast and easy to do in R (+)

    Yes! You saw some examples of this in class. Python can do the
    same but the commands, in my view, are more compsci and less
    natural. Python was just not created for data analysis.

*** Why don't we use RStudio?

    * It's just too slow.

    Not true. Except in the cloud version when it can be very slow
    (depending on your subscription), you'll hardly notice a
    difference. The performance difference is massive and noticeable
    only for large data sets when using RStudio in connection with
    "Tidyverse" packages.

    * It's too tightly linked to the "Tidyverse" (+)

    Yes. Same developers and company. This identification of a library
    of packages ("Tidyverse") with an (commercial) IDE (RStudio) is
    not good for the development of the open source language
    R. Cp. Matloff's "[[https://github.com/matloff/TidyverseSkeptic][Tidyverse Sceptic]]" for details.

    * The learning curve for RStudio is steep (+)

    True, as it is for most IDEs. The value of learning how to use an
    IDE is manifest only when you're developing professionally. IDEs
    tend to make beginners lazy and ignorant because they hide
    important language details.

    * RStudio doesn't have graphics.

    Nope, far from it. Display of graphics is in fact particularly
    comfortable since the graphic device is integrated in the IDE, and
    you can embed graphics directly into R notebooks.

*** R is free software distributed under a GNU license

    (1) TRUE (+)

    (2) FALSE

*** What's a "mirror site"?

    (1) A blank, shiny web page

    (2) A near-identical copy of another site for download purposes
    (+)

    (3) A site with identical URL but different content

    (4) Something that only hackers need to know about

*** How can you print the first few lines of a data set (e.g. ~mtcars~)?

    (1) ~start(mtcars)~

    (2) ~head("mtcars")~

    You should always try a command if you aren't sure or have not
    seen it before. This command is quite interesting. When entering
    it, you get the answer ~"mtcars"~, which is a 1-character data
    set. So this will work in a way but you won't get the first few
    lines of the data set ~datasets::mtcars~ (do you remember how to
    get this full name?)

    (3) ~head(mtcars)~ (+)

    The complete command is ~head(mtcars, n)~ where ~n~ is the number
    of lines printed. Try different values of ~n~.

    (4) ~head <- mtcars~

    Can you see what this does? It overloads the keyword ~head~ that
    is reserved for the function ~head()~ and assigns the data set
    ~mtcars~ to it. You can test that by printing ~head~ before the
    command, and ~head(head)~ after it. Confused?

*** How can you see all the variables and their types stored in a data set (e.g. ~mtcars~)?

    (1) ~vars(mtcars)~

    (2) ~summary(mtcars)~

    This is a valid function - it computes summary statistics for a
    data set. It does this for every variable, but it doesn't show
    individual values or the variable types.

    (3) ~str(mtcars~)~

    That's it. ~str()~ stands for "structure".

    (4) ~ls(mtcars)~

    Another important function that lists all variable names but does not show values or types. You know this command as ~ls()~: without an argument, it prints the variables in the currently active work environment.

*** How do you leave the interactive R console?

    (1) ~exit~

    (2) ~quit()~

    (3) ~q()~

    (4) ~stop()~

*** Before quitting, R will ask you if you wish to save your work space.

    (1) TRUE (+)

    In fact, R will save the "workspace image" if instructed to do
    so. This means a text file with all commands of that session
    (~.Rhistory)~, and a binary (machine-readable only) file with all
    the object definitions made in that session (~.RData~).

    (2) FALSE

*** The command ~rm(list=ls())~ erases your workspace image.

    (1) TRUE

    (2) FALSE (-)

    This command erases all objects of the current work session. It
    does not erase the image. You can test that by entering the
    command and then leaving R with ~q()~ followed by ~y~ (for "yes,
    save the workspace image"). There are still two non empty files
    ~.Rhistory~ and ~.RData~.

*** Base R (downloaded from CRAN) comes with pre-loaded data sets

    (1) TRUE (+)

    (2) FALSE

    You can see these datasets with ~data()~ or the complete command,
    which is ~data(package="datasets")~.

*** What does ~help(x)~ do in R?

    (1) ~help(x)~ leads to an external help page

    No. The command that does this is ~help.start()~.

    (2) ~help(x)~ leads to a help page about the function ~help()~

    No. The command that does this is ~help(help)~.

    (3) Nothing.

    No. "Nothing" (as in: no output or response) happens only when R
    is happy and does something behind the scenes, e.g. load a dataset
    (e.g. ~library(MASS)~), or accept an object assignment (e.g. ~x <-
    1~).

    (4) ~help(x)~ looks for documentation on ~x~ (+)

    Yes! If ~x~ is not a documented function (like ~ls()~) or dataset
    (like ~mtcars~), you are told that there is no documentation
    available (on your computer at least). R suggests you type ~??x~
    to search the help system (check ~help(??)~).

*** What does the following command do: ~options(digits=10)~

    (1) It generates 10 random digits between 0 and 1.

    No. The command ~runif(10)~ does that.

    (2) R gives you the option of choosing a digit between 1 and 10.

    (3) R shuts down in 10 seconds.

    (4) The number of displayed digits is changed. (+)

    Yes! ~options()~ changes display options. Test this by entering
    ~pi~, followed by the command, and then enter ~pi~ again.

*** How do you install an R package? For example ~MASS~.

    (1) ~load(MASS)~

    (2)  ~install.packages(MASS)~

    (3) ~install.packages("MASS")~ (+)

    (4) ~library("MASS")~

*** How do you load an installed package, e.g. ~MASS~, into the current R session?

    (1) ~library(MASS)~ (+)

    (2) ~data(MASS)~

    (3) ~show(MASS)~

    (4) ~open("MASS")~

*** When you use R, you should cite it using ~citation()~

    (1) TRUE (+)

    (2) FALSE

    Not just R - you should always reference software that you used to
    get your results and/or publish them. Software is not like air or
    water, but it is intellectual capital that needs to be credited.

** Test 2 (Week 3 / 31 August)

   This is the second of our series of weekly tests (15% of your final
   grade). You have an unlimited number of attempts. I have added
   feedback to the answers where this might be useful. The tests will
   also form the content of the final exam.

*** Which of these skills are relevant for data science?

    * Mathematics and statistics (+) - Core skills, though depending
      on which area of data science you pick, you need less/different
      math and stats
    * Sales knowledge (+) - an example of domain knowledge ut
      especially relevant because e.g. most online businesses are
      about sales
    * Database management - No, databases can be managed by
      others. You need to know something about connecting and querying
      them, but db management involves e.g. user management, which is
      a completely different skill set and occupation, closer to IT
      support and system programming.
    * Customer service skills - For data science, you need domain
      knowledge, and Customer service KNOWLEDGE would be an example,
      but you don't need the skills to work in this area.

*** How many programming languages exist today?

    * 8,945 (+) - correct answer according to HOPL, the History Of
      Programming Languages society
    * 700 - no. of application areas/programming languages in 1966 according to Landin
    * 300 - no. of notable programming languages today according to Wikipedia
    * 2,000 - no. of natural languages spoken or written in Africa alone

*** What do you need to do when an article gives you a number? (E.g. no. of LinkedIn accounts)

    * Try to make sense of it in relative terms (+) - Correct: numbers
      attain meaning by context and correlation: e.g. how many
      accounts do comparable sites have? How many people participate
      in social media altogether? etc.
    * Check the number using an independent source (+) - Especially if
      the author has not given a source.
    * Be happy that the author quantified the findings - Not enough,
      and also research does not need to be quantitative, it can be
      only qualitative, too.
    * Check the references for sources (+) - Yes, and the statistics,
      if applicable, e.g. if the number comes from an aggregator like
      Statista.

*** Which of these are part of the typical data science process?

    * Modeling, visualizing, communicating data analysis results (+)
    * Data cleaning and data import (+)
    * Machine learning - No. This is part of data science, but not
      typical for every data science process.
    * Coding - Not necessarily, though this depends on your definition
      of "coding". Interpreting existing graphs is also part of the
      data science process. You don't have to be in charge of the
      entire pipeline.

*** What is data science used for?

    * Decision support (+) - Perhaps the most important reason for
      data science, especially in the world of business.
    * Process mining (+) - A specialized application using event logs
      to discover and optimize real processes
    * Machine learning (+) - Also a part of the field of AI. Comes in
      the form of supervised or unsupervised learning. Very algorithm-
      and stats-heavy.
    * Community support - Not really, rather the other way around:
      there is a large, diverse data science community supporting the
      development of the discipline.

*** Which of these languages can be used for data science?

    * Java (+) - Object-oriented multi-purpose PL for industrial
      applications, used e.g. for natural language processing in data
      science
    * C++ (+) - Object-oriented multi-purpose PL, derived from C, good
      for system programming, too
    * Python (+) - Multi-purpose PL
    * R (+) - Statistical PL
    * Julia (+) - Fairly new language esp. good for parallel computing
    * Lisp (+) - Really old functional PL (also core of the extensible
      GNU Emacs editor)
    * SQL (+) - Structured Query Language for relational (table-based)
      databases
    * FORTRAN (+) - Oldest PL specialized on numerical computations
    * GNU Octave (+) - Math and stats PL, Math and stats PL, used by
      Andrew NG in his classic first Machine Learning course at
      Stanford U
    * Processing (+) - Functional language specialized on graphical
      displays, used by artists, among others
    * Snap! (+) - Block-based PL, derived from MIT's Scratch language
      for kids. Cool. Owned by SAP now.
    * English (+) - I didn't say "programming languages"! Important
      for communication, and also see literate programming.

    Fb: If a language can be used depends in practice on existing
    libraries. In principle, any PL can be used for data science - but
    some are harder to learn and with some, it is harder to get certain
    results.

*** How mature is data science as a discipline?

    * Very immature. It is still pretty new and mostly undefined
    * It's mature. Largely standardized and systematically
      structured - No standards exist. Even the typical data science
      pipeline, skills and areas can be argued over.
    * Maturity is difficult to assess because data science develops so
      fast (+)
    * Maturity difficult to assess because data science is so
      interdisciplinary (+) - some areas (like stats) are well, others
      (like machine learning) are less well developed

*** What is the main purpose of Scrum (the agile project management method that we're using)?

    * Happy customer - Implicit assumption, not worth setting as "main
      purpose", though worth highlighting
    * Happy team - Officially irrelevant for project success, alas,
      though practically important.
    * Incremental prototype development (+) - This is key to agility
    * Maximize contact and dialog with the customer (product owner)
      (+) - This is key to staying on track

*** A case study is an in-depth, multi-faceted exploration of complex issues in their real-life settings

    * TRUE (+)
    * FALSE

*** What's CTR in the context of data science for online businesses?

    * Click Through Rate (+) - The rate at which online viewers of an
      advertisement click through to the company's site
    * A similarity measure - This concept is only meaningful if you
      are trying to measure distances, e.g. between scattered points
      for the purpose of making a prediction, or for clustering. CTR
      is not a similarity measure, but a performance measure
    * A performance measure
    * A big data indicator. - Big data are relevant and useful, but
      CTR could be computed for a single customer, too. Big data
      indicators are: high volume, high velocity, high variety (3V)

*** In 2021, data scientists' most basic, universal skill is the ability to write code.

    * TRUE
    * FALSE (+) - This is no longer true. Storytelling/communication,
      analytical skills, contextual and domain knowledge, modeling and
      data wrangling skills have become equally important.

*** Reading assignment - Davenport and Patil (2012)

    * LinkedIn today: 756 mio accounts. No. 1 corporate social media
      usage site in 2021, which means that LinkedIn really has the
      attention of the industry ([[geyser21][Geyser, 2021]]).
    * Goldman wanted to "capitalize on heuristics" - what's that?
    * Type of article: case study.

    #+begin_quote
    "The case study approach allows in-depth, multi-faceted
    explorations of complex issues in their real-life settings. The
    value of the case study approach is well recognised in the fields
    of business, law and policy." ([[crowe11][Crowe et al, 2011]]).
    #+end_quote

    * "People-you-may-know-ads" click-through-rate (CTR) of 30%. How
      good is that? What's the benchmark? Cp. 2016 averages fo Google
      AdWords ([[irvine21][Irvine, 2021]])[fn:6].
    * "LinkedIn's growth trajectory shifted significantly upwards." By
      how much? [[https://www.businessofapps.com/data/linkedin-statistics/][2009-2021 data]] do not confirm or deny that ([[iqbal21][Iqbal, 2021]]).
    * Big data opportunity: Why conditional on data in a form "other
      than in rows and columns of numbers" (i.e. tables)?
    #+begin_quote
    "If your organization stores multiple petabytes of data, if
    the information most critical to your business resides in forms
    other than rows and columns of numbers, or if answering your
    biggest question would involve a “mashup” of several analytical
    efforts, you’ve got a big data opportunity."
    #+end_quote
    * Page 4 describes the data science pipeline or process that is
      still pretty much unchallenged in the industry.
    * Making one's own tools and conduct "academic-style research"
      (what does that mean?)
    * Changes since 2012? (Highlighting is mine)
    #+begin_quote
    "Data scientists’ most basic,universal skill is the ability to
    *write code*. This may be less true in five years’ time, when many
    more people will have the title“data scientist” on their business
    cards. More enduring will be the need for data scientists to
    *communicate* in language that all their stakeholders
    understand—and to demonstrate the special skills involved in
    *storytelling with data*, whether verbally, visually,
    or—ideally—both...the dominant trait is an intense *curiosity*."
    #+end_quote
    * What's scientific about data science?
    * Hiring criteria: "solid foundation in math, statistics,
      probability, and computer science, a feel for business issues
      and empathy for customers." How likely is it that a scientist
      has these qualities? How likely is it that a non-scientist has
      them? (E.g. an expert saleswoman, or a product manager in
      finance).
    * Degrees are typically at graduate (Master) level.
    * Issues: wanting to be "on the [Star Trek] bridge" but having to
      clean data instead all day long.
    * Comparison 1980s and 1990s: [[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financialcareers/08/quants-quantitative-analyst.asp][Wall Street quants]] aka quantitative
      analysts, or quant geeks ([[yates20][Yates, 2020]]) - implement complex pricing models.
    * Other differences: Google competitions, emphasis on machine
      learning and AI, general confusion about the field has grown.
    #+begin_quote
    "Think of big data as an epic wave gathering now, starting to
    crest. If you want to catch it, you need people who can surf."
    #+end_quote

*** EDA project process

    Three processes are aligned with one another for the project,
    which in this course is an Exploratory Data Analysis, an EDA
    project ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsc101/blob/main/syllabus.md#grading-system][cp. Syllabus]]):

    1) term: beginning mid August, ending in early December. Mid-term
       grades are independent of the project.
    2) Scrum: four sprints with four sprint reviews roughly four weeks
       apart. at a sprint review, you present the status of your essay
       prototype.
    3) IMRaD: the introduction with research question (what you wish
       to investigate), the method (how you are going to do it), your
       results (what you found out), and the discussion of your
       results (what it means, how it benefits whom, including the
       limitations of your investigation).

    In week 3 (Aug 30-Sep 3) we will focus on generating ideas and get
    the project set up properly (1st sprint review). [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.md][See also the FAQs]]

    * "What is a sprint review",
    * "What do I need to deliver at a sprint review?"
    * "What should we do in the first sprint?"
    * "What should we do in the second sprint?"
    * "What should we do in the third sprint?"
    * "What should we do in the fourth sprint?"

*** TODO Reading assignment (by Thu 26 Aug, 1 PM)

    Please read the seminal [[https://1drv.ms/b/s!AhEvK3qWokrvhsVoCA7lL4i7m16ElQ][article by Davenport and Patil (2012)]] until
    Thursday - it's not difficult. Write down any questions you may
    have. What do you think has changed (if anything) since 2012?

*** Programming languages

    Here is the admittedly rather obscure 1966 article ([[landin66][Landin, 1966]])
    that begins with the existence of 700 programming languages
    ("1,700 special programming languages [...] in over 700
    application areas"), and proposes a language generation framework
    centered on so-called "primitives"[fn:1]. Wikipedia ([[wiki21][2021]]) lists around
    300 "notable languages" today - another author reports that the
    HOPL list counts 8,945 languages. This includes minor ones,
    completely esoteric languages, dialects (e.g. Python 2 and Python
    3), and markup languages. Given the number of natural languages
    that were spoken or written at some time - 7,099 according to
    [[https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/how-many-languages-are-there-in-the-world.html][WorldAtlas]], 2,000 alone on the African continent ([[michaels19][Michaels,
    2019]]) - this isn't surprising.

*** Video recording

    A video recording of the "data science overview" lecture is
    [[https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6SfZh1-kWXk4Fg0V1zLj9xmoOo6P1Oq0][available via YouTube]]. Ca. 60 min, recorded in October 2020. The
    background is our Berlin apartment (now sold).

*** Podcast

    I mentioned the data science career book by Nolis and Robinson
    ([[career20][Manning, 2020]]). Their first podcast episode (done to promote the
    book) is called "[[https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8zMGQ3ZDlmMC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw/episode/OThhN2RmN2MtNmFhMy00YmVlLTlmYjEtYjViN2ZhN2RjYjQx?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj-ssv-5K7sAhWW0oUKHSitB8YQkfYCegQIARAF][What is Data Science?]]".

** Msg Isaiah Bradford (21 Aug)

   Hi Isaiah,

   I hope you are well. We've completed the first week pretty much
   only with orientation. If you accept my invitation to GitHub, you
   can look at the Syllabus, the orientiation presentation and the
   follow-up documents.

   Please play the "Entry Quiz" which you'll find in Schoology at your
   earliest convenience - this won't take more than 20 minutes.

   Also, please use the Datacamp registration link to register with
   DataCamp and try to complete the first assignment "Intro to
   Basics". You find the link to the assignments in your DataCamp
   dashboard. This is a really easy assignment that shouldn't take you
   more than 20 min either.

   Let me know if you have trouble with any of these. There'll also be
   another short test at the beginning of the next session (I do this
   every week).

   Do you think you'll be back next week? Cheers and have a good
   weekend, MB

   PS. you should probably bring a laptop to class on Thu next week,
   since we'll install R on it. If you don't have a laptop, make sure
   you come early enough to get a lab PC.

** Follow-up 19 Aug

*** Remember words and know concepts

    It may sound trivial and/or tedious to you, but knowing concepts
    and terms, and remembering them is better than having to look them
    up. Being able to look them up is, of course, better than not
    being able to do even that. Learning anything also consists of
    learning a certain number of technical terms. You've probably been
    brought up with Google search, instead of having to go to a book
    shelf or a library, or having to ask a real person. But Google
    does not replace own knowledge - information that you own, and
    that you know you own because you don't have to think twice if
    someone asks you. It is true that there is much less to learn by
    heart in STEM than, say, in poetry, or even in the life sciences
    or medicine. And in future, AI will likely be able to help you
    even more with remembering stuff. But core technical terms and
    concepts aren't just "stuff", they are like scaffold of ideas
    around which the regular stuff is only draped. One of my jobs as a
    teacher is to help you separate the stuff from the scaffold.

    For your presentation, projects, and all that, you need to do some
    semblance of research. When you do that, you should build a
    glossary of terms - definitions that you ideally craft
    yourself. You can also use these definitions in your writing and
    presenting (in other words: a good glossary is a valid research
    result). In fact, Wikipedia is nothing but a giant glossary.

    This is a long explanation why, at the start of a session, I ask
    you if you remember any words or concepts or ideas from the last
    session, and this challenge will also enter the weekly tests that
    you write in class to get back into the topic.

*** Markup and Markdown
    The standard format of text documents on GitHub is markdown. This
    is similar but different from markup language (like HTML). Both
    are formatting languages. HTML (markup) has evolved into HTML5
    (for interactive web pages) and XML (for industrial data
    transfer). Markdown is much simpler but the concept is the same as
    for markup: separation of content and formatting so that you have
    your head free for content and don't have to worry about
    formatting at the same time (which is the WYSIWIG, or What You See
    Is What You Get, concept of WORD and other text processing
    programs).
*** DataCamp
    DataCamp is a training platform specialising on data science in
    three languages, R, Python and SQL, as well as utilities and
    productivity tools (like Git, Shell, etc.). DataCamp has an
    interesting blog with tutorials, webinars, assessments, and
    more. I've used it as a training platform to supplement my
    teaching since a couple of years. The academic alliance with
    DataCamp is worth US$ 300 per year. During your membership, you
    can do any number of courses and earn certificates, which you can
    then e.g. display on your web pages or add to your resume. For
    this course, you are assigned 15 different chapters from different
    DataCamp courses, about one every week. Each chapter will take
    15-30 minutes to complete. You must complete 50% or at least 8
    chapters on time to pass the course. The content is roughly in
    line with the classroom instruction.
*** Laptops in class
    If you don't have a laptop or don't want or can't bring one to
    class, you should come in time to get a lab PC. An own laptop is
    not always necessary, but always useful. If there are not enough
    PC places, you may have to work in pairs on one machine. Having a
    computer to type on is important because your hands develop muscle
    memory - for the same reason you should always type instructions
    yourself and not cut and paste. From week 2 onwards, we'll program
    pretty much every time, so you'll be busy typing.

*** References

    In this course, references must be consistent and complete. You're
    of course used to that from your liberal arts courses. Consistency
    means that you pick one citation style (I don't care which one) -
    e.g. [[https://apastyle.apa.org/][APA]]. If you use bibliographic software (like Mendeley, or
    Citavi, or Zotero), the software will help you pick a style and
    maintain consistency. Completeness means that every reference (no
    matter if you reference a personal communication, a blog, a book,
    an article, a web page, an image etc.) must have: author, date,
    title and place of publication (no matter if any of these are
    missing - then you should indicate that they're missing). A URL or
    link is not a complete reference (in fact, it's nothing, certainly
    not a place of publication). Partly because you're also liberal
    arts people, I pull no punches in this area and I'll mercilessly
    mark you down for violations of this rule ("consistency and
    completeness"), which may appear formal to you, but which is super
    important, especially in our times of relentless abuse and
    ignorance of intellectual property rights! End of rant!
** Follow-up 17 Aug

   Hey, I really enjoyed today's class, I hope you did, too.

   I write a follow-up whenever I said stuff, or put stuff on the
   board that emerged during a session. This is uploaded to GitHub
   where you can comment, ask further, remind me of something I
   promised and forgot, or raise any other issue. This may show up in
   the weekly tests (and then also in the final exam, which is
   sourced from the tests).

   Don't worry about the amount (or type) of information contained
   herein: I write these things up partly for myself, and partly for
   those interested, but I don't expect you to learn or know them at
   any point during this class. And I'll cease writing them up when I
   run out of time, which I often do towards the end of term.

   As part of your term project, you will come across a lot of new
   technical terms. To sort through them, you'll need to create a
   glossary. These follow-ups are my glossary for the course.

   ([[https://drive.google.com/file/d/14GruRbuXnLwofI_6nj8yIAC8P6atYD8I/view?usp=sharing][Whiteboard]])

*** Agile methods
    "Kanban" is the Japanese word for "sign". It stands for a simple
    "agile" method (in the technical sense) of organizing tasks on a
    board using post-its or other means. An app that implements the
    Kanban principle for private users is Trello. Kanban boards -
    often analog rather than digital - are common in production
    (e.g. to keep an overview of warehouse stock). In the course, you
    will use the agile method "Scrum" for your project work. Agile
    methods are widely used in industry and software engineering.
*** LaTeX and TeX
    Gold standard of Open Source text formatting and font systems
    (there is another one just for fonts called Metafont). Created by
    Donald Knuth from Stanford U. who is also the author of the
    seminal "The Art of Computer Programming" ([[knuth11][Knuth, 2011]]), usually
    abbreviated to [[https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html][TAOCP]]. As soon as my boat has arrived from Europe,
    you should take a look at these books, which are mainly about
    algorithms, fairly mathematical, voluminous (10,000 pages) and
    difficult (Bill Gates is rumored to have offered a job at
    Microsoft for anyone who read the whole series). For the book,
    Knuth created an artificial assembly language, MIX, which runs on
    a hypothetical MIX computer. A little like like pseudocode.

*** Git and Linux
    The Linux kernel and the version control program were both
    created by Finnish-American computer programmer Linus
    Torvalds. The connection: Linux is one of the largest (if not the
    largest) open source project. I'll be teaching operating systems
    in Spring 2022, and Linux will figure prominently in that
    course. Git is the software used for the GitHub developers'
    platform (and many other similar platforms, like GitLab,
    BitBucket, SourceForge etc.)

*** Emacs editor
    You're going to hear, and see, enough of this "extensible text
    editor" written in Lisp (one of the oldest functional programming
    languages). Emacs is a great Integrated Development Environment
    (IDE), and much more than that. I use it as an IDE for R in
    connection with the Emacs Speaks Statistics (~ESS~) package, but
    I also use the Org-mode package for all my note taking and task
    management, and as an alternative to the interactive Jupyter
    notebook. Notebooks are an example of Literate Programming,
    another invention of Donald Knuth's.

*** Big Data
    We discussed the meaning of the "3V" definition of big data -
    volume (of the data, usually these days no less than 1 petabyte =
    1 million gigabyte), velocity (speed at which data are streamed
    and, if possible, processed in real time), and variety (the many
    different types and formats of data - audio, video and text). All
    of these can be measured and controlled fairly well - if they can
    be stored, used etc. is a matter of data wrangling (usually the
    most laborious part of the data scientist's work). There are other
    definitions, up to "5V", including "value" (to a beneficiary,
    e.g. a company collecting the data), and "veracity" (which relates
    to data quality - an issue of growing importance). Value and
    veracity are harder to measure directly, which is why I don't
    usually included them in my Big Data definition.
*** Afterword
    I usually pepper the follow-ups with links and articles, but I'm
    tired, and I still have another syllabus to write and a lecture
    to prepare so I'll leave this job to you!

    In our second session later this week, I'll finish the course
    overview and I'll introduce you to the GitHub and DataCamp
    platforms. That'll do for the start!

** Followup 1st Sprint Review Sept 10

   [[./img/rugby.gif]]

*** Presentations in general

   Kudos for the three excellent presentations this morning. I was
   impressed with the results. This was our 10th meeting - only 30
   more to go!

   Key points to remember[fn:13]:

   1) Bullet point lists should be ordered (take control of how the
      audience sees your content, and what they engage with)
   2) Slides should have limited information on them. Limit text
      elements.
   3) Push yourself to provide illustrations, graphs. Analytical
      audiences are especially grateful if you feed their hunger for
      accuracy and validation.
   4) Whenever you quantify, make sure to provide relative numbers and
      sufficient information to place the numbers in the appropriate
      context.

*** Sprint review presentations

    I will leave comments on individual projects in the discussion
    forum, especially if I come across interesting sources. As a
    participant, you can opt to unsubscribe from the forum at any
    time, if you feel that you're getting too much email!

**** Sonny and Dat - Genetic algorithms


**** Spencer and Jacob - Face recognition

     I found an interesting blog post [[http://www.bnosac.be/index.php/blog/89-human-face-detection-with-r][here]] with a short coding example
     that I believe is within your reach. There's also a link to an
     entire course on "[[https://lstat.kuleuven.be/training/coursedescriptions/ComputervisionwithRandPython][Computer vision with R and Python]]" from an
     excellent Belgian university (KU Leuven).

**** Hakeem - Sports performance

     At least three others, Emma and Fortunato (soccer players), and
     Malcolm (football), are also intereste in AI and sports. Malcolm
     also submitted a sprint review. You could even form one team of 4
     people if you wanted to, or two teams of two - I leave it to
     you. It can be an advantage to be in a team with people you
     already know.


** Question Spencer Rhoden (project canvas)

   Hi - Good attempt with some issues (besides typos):

   1) Purpose: this is supposed to be the project purpose, not a topic
      description. Will this make the customer happy? If this is for
      your project, what are you trying to achieve. Are you going to
      create software to "predict keypoint positions on face images"?
      I think not. Your presentation probably has an educational
      purpose.
   2) Team: which communities, which collaborators in these
      communities? More specific.
   3) Risks: family, illness etc. are "trivial" in the sense that they
      are not specific to this project. They will always happen
      (e.g. you would not register meal times under "time budget"
      because you always have to eat anyway). Stimulate (I like the
      term!): what is a "good community". Example so you know what to
      look for?
   4) Waypoints: list every waypoint, like every single sprint review
      and what you want you need for it, and in the right order.

   Hope this helps! Good of you to ask!

   Cheers,
   MB

** Followup September 8, 2021

   [[[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SfCzPaNpoPtwiCgAJR20pLNWirQh_x9D?usp=sharing][Whiteboards]]]
   [[[mit61][Video]]]

   This session was a bit of an experiment: I didn't know if it would
   work to show you a video and discuss it - given the results (see
   whiteboards), I think it did, and we'll develop the section
   "History of AI" over several sessions using the remainder of this
   video, which is rich in examples.

   Going back to original sources (like this video) isn't really
   common outside of the field of history of science, because of the
   reasons discussed in class: technology seems to move too fast to
   bother with anything older than 10 years. However, in practice, you
   are constantly confronted with the history of computer science -
   via us, your instructors. Good instructors are rarely younger than
   40, which means that they can look 20 years into the past. Older
   ones (50-70) can look even further. At some point, the advantage of
   knowing the past may tip over into a disadvantage of being wed to
   it. I have not personally experienced this - but I still have a few
   years to go before I reach the critical threshold[fn:12].

*** Metropolis (1927)

    Alas, I kind of botched the plot description of this film. In
    fact, it's eerily more like the 2020's - it involves identity
    theft and transfer of the stolen identity of the female
    protagonist, Maria to the robot (aka "Hel"), who "unleashes chaos
    throughout Metropolis, driving men to murder and stirring dissent
    among the workers."

    In fact, the plot [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_(1927_film)#Plot][summary on Wikipedia]] is so confused that I
    recommend you watch the film for yourself! [[https://youtu.be/OZ_mcUz8hkQ][It's on YouTube]][fn:11].

    Whatever the whole story, this is Frankenstein with
    robots. Interestingly, I had a conversation with a Catholic priest
    yesterday where he likened social media to Frankenstein, and I
    Frankenstein has been used as a metaphor for data science ([[frankenstein][Reaney,
    2017]]).

*** Darling Sweetheart (1951)

    The challenge: "Can computers really create anything new?"

*** Samuel's checkers bot

    [[./img/samuel.jpeg]]

    /Image: Arthur Samuel (1901-1990) playing checkers at SAIL
    (1970)./

    #+begin_quote
    "Samuel's papers on machine learning are still worth studying. With
    great creativity and working essentially alone, doing his own
    programming, he invented several seminal techniques in rote learning
    and generalization learning, using such underlying techniques as
    mutable evaluation functions, hill climbing, and signature tables. One
    still hears proposals for research in this area less sophisticated
    than his work of the 1950s." ([[obit][McCarthy, 1990]])
    #+end_quote

    Samuel's original article that first introduced the term "machine
    learning" is highly readable ([[sam51][Samuel, 1959]]). I've assigned it to
    students as a term project in the past. The abstract of the
    reprint (2000) reads as follows:

    #+begin_quote
    "The studies reported here have been concerned with the
    programming of a digital computer to behave in a way which, if
    done by human beings or animals, would be described as involving
    the process of learning. While this is not the place to dwell on
    the importance of machine-learning procedures, or to discourse on
    the philosophical aspects,1 there is obviously a very large amount
    of work, now done by people, which is quite trivial in its demands
    on the intellect but does, nevertheless, involve some learning. We
    have at our command computers with adequate data-handling ability
    and with sufficient computational speed to make use of
    machine-learning techniques, but our knowledge of the basic
    principles of these techniques is still rudimentary. Lacking such
    knowledge, it is necessary to specify methods of problem solution
    in minute and exact detail, a time-consuming and costly
    procedure. Programming computers to learn from experience should
    eventually eliminate the need for much of this detailed
    programming effort."

** Test 3 (week 4 / 8 September, 2021)

   Third weekly quiz. Ungraded, does not count towards your final
   grade. If you also attend the data modeling seminar(DSC 482.02),
   you will recogize several of these questions, because research is a
   common denominator of both 482 courses.

** Session Protocols

   Post your protocol here. Take a look at [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/blob/main/2_what_is_ai/protocol_23_aug.md][my example protocol]].

** Followup 3 September 2021

*** Team vs. Solo, Presentation vs. AI Application Project

**** Solo presentation
     This presentation is already [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/blob/main/schedule.md][scheduled]] (notice that all
     presentation dates are now after Fall Break). You can pick a
     topic related to your team project, but you don't have to. The
     purpose of the presentation is to research a topic and present it
     to class. The presentation should take about 30 minutes. If it is
     longer, that's OK. You can base it on secondary sources (e.g. a
     chapter in AIMA). You have to upload your slides/materials for
     the solo presentation *[[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/tree/main/presentations][to this GitHub repo before your
     presentation date]]*.

     Alas, I do not have a rubric for the presentation. I'd like for
     the presentation to generate questions for discussion. You should
     think about ways to make it more interactive - identifying
     questions for discussion is a minimum.

     We'll discuss the formal presentation framework before Fall
     Break.

**** Team project
     You should have found a team by now (2-3 people). Your job in
     that team is to work towards researching an AI application in a
     chosen topic area. You present your idea as part of the sprint
     review on September 9 (the first of four reviews). As a team, you
     only have 5 minutes, followed by 5 minutes for Q&A. This will
     take all of the Friday session. For the sprint review, apply the
     FAQ. *[[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/tree/main/3_ai_projects/1_sprint_review][Upload your slides to this GitHub repo]]* no later than
     Friday, September 9, 9 AM.

     To organize your project, you can e.g. use GitHub Projects. Here
     is [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/projects/1][an example from me]]. You can define your own project and create
     a Kanban board, delegate tasks etc. Such a tool is more useful if
     you work in a team. Check it out!

*** Topic submissions feedback and next steps

    I will give feedback directly [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/discussions/4][in the GitHub discussion forum]]. The
    next steps for everyone is to turn your topic into a (much
    smaller) research question so that you can actually research,
    validate, and present it. Post your research question in the REPLY
    thread of your original submission.

    You can also talk to me in, before or after class, or send me a
    mail any time. What's not Okay is to just drop a deadline without
    a valid excuse (see [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/blob/main/syllabus.md#assignments-and-honor-code][syllabus]]).

** Submit ideas for your presentation (30 Aug)

   Submit your ideas here as a commont on this post by Wednesday,
   September 1, 9 AM.

   Put the tentative title of your presentation topic (or topics, if
   there are several you're thinking about) into the subject line.  In
   the body of your post, put references or thoughts (e.g. why you
   want to present this topic - what motivates), or concerns (which
   difficulties concern you).  References (literature, sites, blogs
   etc.) are most important if you have them, because they help to
   validate the topic.

   Your topics should have available DATA, be DOABLE, you should
   already have some KNOWLEDGE (i.e. use what you already know or have
   learnt), and you should be MOTIVATED to research them.

   We'll discuss this on Wednesday.

** Followup 30 August 2021

   [[[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1J9WtDXQNT8DQiPT9G5Gx0TEiBr8SeC3F?usp=sharing][Whiteboard]]]

*** This Week's Must Do's

    1) By Wednesday: identify a (solo) presentation topic and post it
       in the [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/discussions/4][discussion forum]].
    2) By Friday: find a team - 2-3 people with whom to work on the AI
       application challenge prepare for and present at the sprint
       reviews (see [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/blob/main/schedule.md][schedule]]).

*** Easiest way to find a topic

    Use the textbook, AIMA. Any chapter of that book will be a
    suitable presentation topic. In most cases, a whole chapter will
    be too much, and a subchapter will suffice: notice that it took us
    an entire week to get through chapter 1.1 of AIMA.

    The more mathematical chapters, or those dealing with algorithms,
    may be more suitable if you have a mathematical mind. If you're
    interested in applications and business, focus on that. If you're
    into programming and computing tech, go there. Some chapter are
    philosophical and deal with difficult questions of ethics etc.

    Whatever you pick, make sure that you don't start from a zero
    baseline, i.e. assuming nothing. Use the fact that you are seniors
    and show off what you already know - stats, algorithms, design,
    whatever.

    We've discussed other ways of finding topics in the past: e.g. by
    taking another book (even a non-fiction book like "Book of Why",
    or "Algorithms to live by", "Prediction machines" etc., or a
    semi-technical book like "From zero to AI"); by going to an
    article in the [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/blob/main/bookmarks.md][bookmarks file]], or any other article that interests
    you. Could be a seminal article from the past, like Turing's 1947
    paper, or the paper on creating AI that plays checkers by Samuels,
    or another article by one of the greats like Marvin Minsky.

*** More papers - ideas for presentations or applications

    Here are some papers with topics and applications that I found
    recently and that I haven't been able to add to the bookmarks file
    yet (partly because I'm not sure they're suitable):

    Each of these contains one or more interesting ideas and is
    difficult, or superficial, or obscure enough to warrant your
    efforts to unlock its contents.

*** Creating questions on what you've just learnt

    This sounds as difficult as it is! I did not mean for it to sound
    trivial, either. There are a few tricks though:

    * Begin with (technical) terms or concepts that you cannot define,
      and ask "what does this mean?"
    * Check out Internet sites like Quora, Stackoverflow, or Reddit
      for questions that others asked about the topic.
    * Post the topic to friends, colleagues or family and ask them
      what they'd like to know[fn:7].
    * Imagine having to explain the topic to a 5, a 10, a 15 and a
      20-year old person[fn:8].

*** "AI Application" project process

    Three processes are aligned with one another for the project,
    which in this course is an AI application ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/blob/main/syllabus.md#grading-system][cp. Syllabus]]):

    1) term: beginning mid August, ending in early December. Mid-term
       grades are independent of the project.
    2) Scrum: four sprints with four sprint reviews roughly four weeks
       apart. at a sprint review, you present the status of your essay
       prototype.
    3) IMRaD: the introduction with research question (what you wish
       to investigate), the method (how you are going to do it), your
       results (what you found out), and the discussion of your
       results (what it means, how it benefits whom, including the
       limitations of your investigation).

    In week 3 (Aug 30-Sep 3) we will focus on generating ideas and get
    the project set up properly (1st sprint review). [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.md][See also the FAQs]]

    * "What is a sprint review",
    * "What do I need to deliver at a sprint review?"
    * "What should we do in the first sprint?"
    * "What should we do in the second sprint?"
    * "What should we do in the third sprint?"
    * "What should we do in the fourth sprint?"

*** Book recommendations

    [[https://www.amazon.com/Turings-Cathedral-Origins-Digital-Universe/dp/1400075998][George Dyson, Turing's Cathedral]]. Vintage books (2012).

    #+begin_quote
    "In the 1940s and ‘50s, a small group of men and women—led by John von
    Neumann—gathered in Princeton, New Jersey, to begin building one of
    the first computers to realize Alan Turing’s vision of a Universal
    Machine. The codes unleashed within this embryonic, 5-kilobyte
    universe—less memory than is allocated to displaying a single icon on
    a computer screen today—broke the distinction between numbers that
    mean things and numbers that do things, and our universe would never
    be the same. Turing’s Cathedral is the story of how the most
    constructive and most destructive of twentieth-century inventions—the
    digital computer and the hydrogen bomb—emerged at the same time."
    #+end_quote

    I also recommended virtually any book by the George Dyson's
    father, [[https://www.ias.edu/sns/dyson][Freeman Dyson (Princeton, Institute for Advanced Study)]].

*** Google scholar alert

    I use this alert to remain informed about current articles - when
    I find something directly relevant to a course, I put it in the
    bookmarks file. You may need to have to register ([[https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Vvnwsv0AAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1][here's my
    account]]).

    Since the Google search algorithm is not known, the alert is not
    reliable (in the sense that one might miss an important
    publication). The best alternative is to look for recent
    literature review articles.

** Msg for week 3

   Test 2 is live. There are also new diary entries in GitHub, both in
   the /org and in the /ai482 repo.

   Our focus next week will be on the setup of the presentations and
   projects: bring IDEAS for both to class for discussion. You can
   form your own teams of 2-3 members. By the end of the week, you
   should know your team, your topics and your sprint review tasks.

** Test 2 (week 3 / 30 August)

   * [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/blob/main/2_what_is_ai/protocol_23_aug.md][Followup 23 Aug]]
   * [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/blob/main/2_what_is_ai/2_what_is_ai.md][Lecture What is AI?]]

   This is the second test in our series of weekly quizzes. This week's
   questions are based on the "What is AI" sessions and lectures.

*** When designing AI, we should focus on humans
    * TRUE
    * FALSE (-)

    #+begin_notes
    Both focus on humans and focus on machines are popular
    approaches. The focus on machines is currently even more popular,
    as evidenced by the name "machine learning". This could have to do
    with the fact that focusing on humans requires knowledge of human
    behavior and human thought that we do often not possess: it is
    difficult to build a machine that thinks like a person if we don't
    know how a person thinks.
    #+end_notes

*** What does the term "standard model" refer to?

    * Constructing agents that "do the right thing" (+) - Correct in
      the context of AI.
    * A set of minimal criteria for designing AI - There is no such set
    * The fact that AI tends to offer standardized solutions - AI does
      not do that, rather the opposite.
    * A model of example established by general consent (+) -
      Dictionary definition of "standard".

*** What do you have to do for the session protocol?

    * Meet the deadline (1 week) (+)
    * Check spelling and grammar of your submission (+)
    * Find URLs (links) for all references
    * Add your personal reflection of the session (+)
    * Imitate the professor's example

*** Science agrees on the meaning of "intelligence"

    * TRUE
    * FALSE (+)

*** What's the Turing Test about?

    * The ability of humans to interact with a robot
    * The ability of machines to think
    * The ability of a machine to pass as human (+)
    * The ability of a human to pass as a machine

*** Which of the following AI designs are "rational agents"?

    * AI designs that exhibit rational thought
    * AI designs that exhibit rational behavior (+)
    * AI that tries to achieve an optimal outcome (+)
    * AI that tries to think logically
    * A robot that is not allowed to harm humans (+)
    * A robot that will never destroy itself

    #+begin_notes
    * AI designs that exhibit rational thought = laws of thought approach
    * AI designs that exhibit rational behavior (+)
    * AI that tries to achieve an optimal outcome (+)
    * AI that tries to think logically = laws of thought approach
    * A robot that is not allowed to harm humans (+) - this is the
      first of Asimov's law - it amounts to "doing the right thing",
      and is not to be mistaken with "human behavior" as one might
      think.
    * A robot that will never destroy itself - 3rd Asimov robot law
      but without the important mention of preserving the other two
      laws. Otherwise, the guiding principle could lead to a
      catastrophe: it's clearly not "doing the right thing" if a human
      dies because of it.)

    #+end_notes

*** Which of these are major issues with the rational agent approach?

    * Imperfect rationality (+)
    * Valuation agreement
    * Value alignment (+)
    * Limited boundaries

*** What does "bounded rationality" mean?

    * Humans are not perfectly rational (+)
    * Data has no value unless put in the context of appropriate models (+)
    * A refinement or corollary to the standard model of AI (+)
    * The optimal action is not always possible in complex environments (+)
    * AI needs to take human nature and culture into account (+)

*** The values put into the machine must be aligned with Christian values
    * TRUE
    * FALSE (-)

    TRUE: "Christian values" are only a special set of values, not shared by all
    users of AI. Only those in favor of Christian values would insist on
    using them as design principles, adherents of other religions may not.

    FALSE: Without the "Christian", this would be true, according to
    AIMA.

*** What do you need to validate a research question?

    * Peer review (+) - Other experts or people engaged in similar
      experts are your peers. They need to agree that your purpose is
      relevant.
    * Literature review (+) - This is the secondary research that
      contains the peer review.
    * Spelling and grammar check - It will make validation perhaps
      more difficult, but you don't need to do it to be relevant.
    * A validation app - Validation is usually not a standarizable,
      automatable task (only for formal criteria) - not easily
      quantifiable
    * Minimize your bias (+) - This is important, because bias
      invalidates your research (if it is not made public at least).

    You'll learn this when you publish or do research (not necessarily in
    college).

** Test 1 (week 2 / 23 August)

    - arxiv.org (+)
    - scholar.google.com (+)
    - researchgate.net (+)
    - schoology.net
    - google.com (+)
    - any scientific publisher's site
*** Which areas of knowledge are relevant to AI as a part of Data Science?
    - Domain knowledge ("Know how") (+)
    - Domestic knowledge ("Know where")
    - Mathematics and statistics (+)
    - Programming and computing (+)
    - Biostatistics
    - Autonomous cars
*** AI in data science is mostly concerned with "machine learning".
    - TRUE (+)

    - Automatic performance of single, simple tasks by a computer (+)
    - Many AI applications in the area of IoT (+)
    - ANI includes Robotic Process Automation (RPA) tasks (+)
** Protocol (Aug 23, 2021) [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/blob/main/2_what_is_ai/protocol_23_aug.md][(GitHub)]]

   By Marcus Birkenkrahe (MB) aka "The professor"

   This was the 2nd week of the course, and the first week with
   content other than just orientation.

*** Housekeeping
**** First weekly test

     The [[https://lyon.schoology.com/course/5071626602/materials#!filter_type=assessments][test]] asked about "ANI" for "Artificial Narrow Intelligence",
     as opposed to "AGI" for "Artificial General Intelligence". Most
     of the practical AI that we see is AI. AGI, or machines that are
     (nearly) as intelligent as humans, does not really exist[fn:3].

     One can get preprints (and other research documents) from
     researchgate.net (here is [[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marcus-Birkenkrahe][MB's profile]]). Like arxiv.org, this
     site is not curated though, i.e. everyone can put their work
     there (without external validation)[fn:4].

     The question "Is AI in data science the same thing as Machine
     Learning (ML)?" was tricky, because this is ~TRUE~ for AI in
     data science, while for AI overall, ML is only a sub-field
     (though a dominant one at current).

     Students should let MB know if they find any mistakes in the
     tests.

**** Scheduling

     Students were supposed to schedule a protocol (like this one),
     and a presentation using this document in GitHub. Those who did
     not schedule themselves will be assigned a date by MB.

     MB said this was the first time that he had people write
     protocols, and that he was open to pretty much anything[fn:5].

**** Diary

     MB writes irregular diary entries on GitHub, one diary is for
     all courses, the other one only for this course. [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/diary.md#org5bbaf46][In his general
     diary]], he complained about having to teach masked students.

*** Session Topic: What is AI?

**** Career advice

     MB showed the home pages of the two authors of AIMA (2021), the
     main textbook for the course. One of them is Google's director
     of research, Peter Norvig. One way to establish a relationship
     with people like these is to look at their [[http://www.norvig.com/][publications]], and ask
     them questions - make contact via shared interests.

**** Pair exercise - What is intelligence?

     Students were supposed to develop definitions of "intelligence"
     and "artificial intelligence". MB did not offer any
     solution. Instead, he went through the 5 different attempts and
     analyzed each of them: he pointed out differences and
     similarities.

     Most definitions of AI boiled down to a form of human
     intelligence executed by a machine. Different forms of
     intelligence were mentioned: the ability to think abstractly,
     solve problems, adapt, and learn.

     Knowledge and information were distinguished. In "Knowledge
     Management", data, information, knowledge and wisdom can be seen
     as a ladder:

     |-------------|
     | Wisdom      |
     |-------------|
     | Knowledge   |
     |-------------|
     | Information |
     |-------------|
     | Data        |
     |-------------|

     According to [[weinberger2010][Weinberger (2010)]], this hierarchy goes back to the
     poem "The Rock" by T.S. Eliot. As the article points out, there
     are several issues with this hierarchy. It comes from a time
     when data wasn't supposed to be of much value, while today,
     "Data Is The New Oil" ([[forbes2019][Bhageshpur, 2019]]).

     MB asked if the students had thought of people, processes or
     products (a common framework in quality management and in
     [[penner2021][entrepreneurship]]) when coming up with the definitions, and all
     three approaches were represented.

**** Lecture

     One can approach big topics like AI from different angles:
     language (e.g. definitions, as in the group exercise);
     philosophy or history (classical liberal arts disciplines); or
     science. Science is useful when a quantitative treatment is
     possible (i.e. when there are observations that one can make and
     quantify or measure).

     The two opposing fundamental questions when looking at AI are:
     should we focus on humans, or should we focus on machines?
     Currently (perhaps because human intelligence is too hard to
     study and/or imitate), the focus is more strongly on machine
     intelligence.

     Four approaches can be identified:

     * AI that has human behavior (as in the 1985 film "Terminator")
     * AI that has human thought (as in the 2013 film "Her")
     * AI that has rational thought (as in the 1998 film "Pi")
     * AI that has rational behavior (as in the 2002 film "Minority
       Report")

*** Summary view

    I liked the group exercise as an opportunity to interact, get up
    and do something (instead of just being talked at). I thought it
    was interesting how many different definitions of "intelligence"
    the students came up with. Among the different perspectives on
    AI, I'm looking forward to philosophy and history.

** Week 2, 23 Aug
*** Housekeeping
**** Test
**** Scheduling
**** [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/blob/main/2_what_is_ai/2_what_is_ai.pdf][Lecture: What is AI?]]
**** Group exercise: what is intelligence?
     Results (whiteboard photos)

** Discussion 21 August (pick dates)

   As discussed in class, we must fill the schedule for protocols and
   presentations. Let me know in the forum if you encounter any
   difficulty.

*** Enter your own name in the schedule

    I have uploaded a file "[[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/blob/main/schedule.md][schedule.md]]" where you can enter your
    presentation/protocol dates directly (link below). To do this,
    open the file for editing (click on the little pen in the upper
    right corner). The markdown (.md) file in this case is pure
    HTML. Find one of the strings "Session Protocol X" and
    "Presentation Y" and replace them with your name. Click "Preview"
    before saving to check. To save, go to the bottom of the page and
    click on "Commit changes"[fn:2]. Schedule session protocol dates
    marked "X" (for extra credit) only *after* you scheduled your
    regular protocol session.

*** What should you present?

    There is a new FAQ "[[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/blob/main/FAQ.md#org9a7b6e4][Can we use any AI application for our
    presentation?]]" based on Hakeem's question (that's a point for
    participation, Hakeem!) This may help you decide what/when to
    do. If in doubt, ask here and/or ask in class. Instead of
    peppering the FAQ with potential Q&A that nobody ever reads (in my
    experience), I'll wait for your questions.

*** AI project

    The AI application project ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/blob/main/syllabus.md][see syllabus]]) for which we use Scrum
    is a team project - 2-3 people should work on an application
    together. The protocol and the presentation on the other hand, are
    individual assignments.
** Msg 21 August (pick dates)[[https://lyon.schoology.com/link?a=1954606109&path=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbirkenkrahe%2Fai482%2Fdiscussions%2F2][(Schoology)]]

   Hi! Please take a look at my announcement in GitHub and register
   for a protocol and a presentation. I've also uploaded the 2nd
   follow-up document for last week. These follow-ups are similar to
   the type of protocol that I envision you creating after a
   session. If you haven't signed up until we meet again on Tuesday
   Aug 24, I'll schedule you myself. Notice that we need someone for
   August 25 already.Cheers, MB

   PS. I have not used GitHub discussion forums before - I haven't
   figured out how to turn email notification on for new forum msg. If
   anyone figures it out: let us know!

** Follow-up 20 August 2021
*** Arxiv Sanity Preserver
    This is a follow-on from the last follow-up (18 August) where I
    mentioned arxiv-sanity. The site itself is a little hard to find -
    it's https://another-arxiv-sanity.site/. A good introduction is [[https://youtu.be/S2GY3gh6qC8][in
    this video]]. The creator, Andrej Karpathy, is the chief data
    scientist of Tesla Motors today. He came up with this
    in 2016. This site would be a suitable subject for a short
    presentation followed by a discussion. Identifying and searching
    through relevant research is a huge issue for any developer. I
    don't know if the code for Arxiv Sanity Preserver is public or if
    it is private, like Google's search engine. It would be a huge
    advantage to know the algorithm for result validation.
*** Data science
    I've mentioned it here and there - this AI seminar is part of
    Lyon's new data science program. I gave a high level definition of
    data science as an interdisciplinary field. It overlaps with (most
    of AI, in the form of machine learning, or ML), and requires
    skills in three areas: (1) maths and stats, (2) programming and
    computing, and (3) domain knowledge (i.e. deep knowledge of, or
    experience with, a practical application involving data in the
    real world). A quick survey revealed that seven of you were
    focused on (2), and two each on (1) and (3). Within this program,
    the current AI seminar will be followed by two other classes - (A)
    one focusing on hardware, e.g. involving IoT, the other (B) on
    software, on machine learning (statistics and algorithms). My
    spring 2022 classes DSC 201 (machine learning) and CSC 420
    (operating systems) will address these.
*** Consciousness
    This is one of the perennial problems of the search for AGI,
    Artificial General Intelligence. In the session, I mentioned a
    recent discovery - a talk by mathematical physicist Sir Roger
    Penrose on consciousness and physics ([[penrose17][The Artificial Intelligence
    Channel, 2017]]). This is about a very limited aspect of
    consciousness, namely understanding mathematical
    things. Fascinating talk by one of the great minds of our time.
*** Agile management
    The projects in all my courses use the agile management method
    Scrum. Rather than introduce this in the abstract, we will
    practice it. The curve on the whiteboard showed my ambition for
    you: you should have about equal workload and enthusiasm
    throughout the term, and finish early, before finals take your
    breath and energy away. The other aspect of Scrum that is really
    important is customer dialogue. In this course, you have to create
    an application (ideally in a small team), and I'll play your
    customer (or project owner, in Scrum speech).
*** The Internet of Things
    IoT is the name for a network of machines. They are often small,
    with little processing power, like a micro controller, but strong
    in large numbers. There's even a "[[https://makerfreedom.com/what-is-the-maker-movement-5-things-you-should-know/][maker movement]]" ([[powell20][Powell, 2020]]) -
    very popular in Europe - that focuses mainly on these small
    devices and uses them to demonstrate and teach computing at the
    hardware level (device examples are: BBC micro:bit, Raspberry Pi,
    Arduino). I've got a couple of these with whom I've played - this
    will also have a place in my operating systems course (CSC
    420). For our seminar, it is important that IoT is increasingly
    acquiring AI, or more specifically, ANI (Artificial Narrow
    Intelligence, as opposed to AGI, or Artificial General,
    i.e. human, intelligence). AGI is a continuation of the past
    interest in AI, while ANI has become popular only relatively
    recently, but dominates the field nowadays (e.g. in the form of
    "deep learning" applications, deeply layered neural networks).

*** Swarm intelligence
    The idea that a very large number of individually stupid devices
    or entities, when networked, can attain intelligence, has
    intrigued thinkers for decades. One of them is the Pole [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem][Stanislaw
    Lem]] (coincidentally, the Polish Parliament has declared 2021 the
    Stanislaw Lem year), a philosopher and science fiction writer. Two
    of his books are "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(novel)][Solaris]]", about a thinking ocean that covers an
    entire water planet, and "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invincible][The Invincible]]" that describes how
    nanobots defeat an invincible spaceship. Look for Lem's writing,
    he's a clever classic. "Solaris" was also filmed by the visionary
    Russian director Tarkovsky (and there's a US remake with George
    Clooney, too).
*** References

    In this course, references must be consistent and complete. You're
    of course used to that from your liberal arts courses. Consistency
    means that you pick one citation style (I don't care which one) -
    e.g. [[https://apastyle.apa.org/][APA]]. If you use bibliographic software (like Mendeley, or
    Citavi, or Zotero), the software will help you pick a style and
    maintain consistency. Completeness means that every reference (no
    matter if you reference a personal communication, a blog, a book,
    an article, a web page, an image etc.) must have: author, date,
    title and place of publication (no matter if any of these are
    missing - then you should indicate that they're missing). A URL or
    link is not a complete reference (in fact, it's nothing, certainly
    not a place of publication). Partly because you're also liberal
    arts people, I pull no punches in this area and I'll mercilessly
    mark you down for violations of this rule ("consistency and
    completeness"), which may appear formal to you, but which is super
    important, especially in our times of relentless abuse and
    ignorance of intellectual property rights! End of rant!

** Follow-up 18 August 2021

   I write a follow-up whenever I said stuff, or put stuff on the
   board that emerged during a session. I upload it to GitHub where
   you can comment, ask further, remind me of something I promised and
   forgot, or raise any other issue. This may show up in the weekly
   tests (and then also in the final exam, which is sourced from the
   tests). I'll demonstrate GitHub and how to work with it in the
   first week.

   Don't worry about the amount (or type) of information contained
   herein: I write these things up partly for myself, and partly for
   those interested, but I don't expect you to learn or know them at
   any point during this class. And I'll cease writing them up when I
   run out of time, which I often do towards the end of term.

   As part of your term project, you will come across a lot of new
   technical terms. To sort through them, you'll need to create a
   glossary. These follow-ups are my glossary for the course.

   ([[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Klhy3muIH7_GwN4aNRjrTW5507l237Zo?usp=sharing][Whiteboard]])

*** On ignorance
    This relates to the sentence I put on the blackboard at the start
    (not actually a quote - or at least none I have ever heard):
    #+begin_quote
    "The ignorance of the teacher is the bliss of the student."
    #+end_quote
    I hope this didn't make me look too bad! There were several
    serious issues behind it: (1) I'm necessarily ignorant: data
    science is a vast, interdisciplinary field, overlapping to a large
    extent (certainly more than 50% though that does of course depend
    on one's definitions) with AI, which is another vast,
    interdisciplinary field. It would be very hard for a lecturer to
    know most about either of these, and harder even, to teach it to
    undergraduates in the course of one seminar (no matter how
    advanced). Instead, what you get is a foundation to move on if you
    wish. (2) If a teacher acts in good faith and does not pretend to
    know stuff he or she doesn't actually know, it's easier to go on a
    journey of discovery together. (3) There is this other saying (I
    don't know by whom, perhaps Confucius?): when the student is
    ready, the (right) teacher will appear. This is a little like that
    in that it's a paradox. Interestingly, paradoxa count as models,
    too. I should write an article or a diary post about this - (too)
    many thoughts are rushing in!
*** GitHub
    I'll introduce it in class, no need to say much about it
    here. GitHub is the premier hosting side of code for
    developers. There are many others. I use it for course
    documents. There is also a "GitHub classroom" site and application
    suite, but I haven't really looked at it much. If anyone knows
    more, let me know!
*** Time management
    Francesco Cirillo, the creator of the "Pomodoro" method ([[cirillo18][Cirillo,
    2018]]), is a good friend of mine (though an Italian, he lives and
    works in Berlin). I like this and other time management methods,
    but if you want to beat procrastination and bad (?) time
    management, look at it as "risk management": assess the risk of
    being late, or being on time, for every instance, hold it against
    the requirements of your character, your culture etc. Time
    management is not a matter of just the right recipe. Public
    discussions of this issue are often embarrassingly shallow and
    useless.
*** IMRaD
    IMRaD stands for Introduction + Method + Results + Discussion. It
    is the standard format for scientific publications. There is a
    little more to it, but not much: the proof lies in the pudding
    (the doing), not in the concept. I made a short video about it a
    little while back [[birkenkrahe16][(Birkenkrahe, 2016)]].
*** arxiv.org
    This is a preprint server - a place to upload and download
    scientific papers before they are properly published by a journal
    (print or online). There is also arxiv-sanity, an AI-driven app
    that selects papers for you based on profile and
    preferences. Check it out.

** Followup 1st Sprint Review Sept 9

   [[./img/rugby.gif]]

*** Presentations in general

     It was a good start for this round of sprint reviews. This was
     quite difficult given that you know little about modeling as of
     yet. Also, you're going to learn quite different tools - tools
     that you will not necessarily be able to use for your essays.

     At this point, the topics of your essays are not written in stone:
     if research proves too difficult, you may want to pick a simpler
     or a different topic.

     A few of you did not participate in the sprint reviews: please
     post your reviews in the discussion forum so that I can comment
     and/or talk to me. Do not drop the next deadline. You're up to
     present next time!

     Always pay extra attention to references and to proper citing. I
     am a stickler for consistency and completeness of references. 

     For the next sprint review on October 7, you need to create
     slides according to the (minimal) sprint review rules, and make a
     slightly greater formal presentation effort[fn:13].

*** Sprint review presentations

    Congratulations on the first round of presenters: all of these
    were super interesting. The research questions throughout are
    still too broad. Use literature or other sources to narrow them.

    I will leave comments on individual projects in the discussion
    forum, especially if I come across interesting sources. As a
    participant, you can opt to unsubscribe from the forum at any
    time, if you feel that you're getting too much email!

    If anyone has questions or suggestions for the authors of the
    reviews, feel free to comment [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/mod482/discussions/2][directly in the forum]].

** Followup September 7, 2021

   [[[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RRCxbq-3j3kj6KqGoYFOEN6CxlXYkSDj?usp=sharing][Whiteboards]]]

   I enjoyed our pair exercise on Tuesday. The question you worked on
   was far from trivial - it was pretty complex. It was also a "meta"
   question that was hiding a many-model approach: the question was
   about one model (Scrum = agile project management), and used
   another model (3P = people, product, process). The 3P model is a
   quality model, while Scrum is a project process model. The latter
   is contained in the former, which makes the analysis tricky, and
   accounts for the fact that you had difficulty filling in the
   "process" column. This only occurred to me just now: in fact, I
   should have started with a simpler question!

*** People + Product + Process = Profits?

    Though quality management is an old hat, the 3P model is still
    used a lot, especially by startups. Here is a recent article
    ([[penner21][Penner, 2021]]) that argues for putting "profits" after the 3P when
    building companies. Now, maintaining companies (especially large
    ones, which is what I know something of) is quite different from
    building (small) companies aka startups. Still, all points of view
    are interesting, and this article (like many similar ones)
    operates with different models - e.g. a "learning loop"model, a
    people performance model, a motivation model (SCARF), and a
    management model ("Rapid Adaptive Management").

*** Efficiency vs. Resilience

    This is another big topic, especially in sofware engineering. I
    mentioned an article I had read that morning ([[vardi][Vardi, 2021]]). The
    title contains the conclusion: "Engineers and economists prize
    efficiency, but nature favors resilience – lessons from Texas,
    COVID-19 and the 737 Max". I am not entirely sure that it is fair
    to pitch efficiency against resilience. Several of the comments on
    the article make a similar point. Still, the examples seem well
    chosen, though especially regarding COVID, the data are sparse.

    I'm passing this on but I will have to brood over the article for
    a little longer myself. In information systems design, resilience
    is an important factor, as is efficiency - but both are compound
    qualities, and not directly measurable.

    Whenever a quality is not directly measureable, bias must be
    watched extra carefully, because this bias enters the definition
    of the metrics.

** Test 3: Decision Intelligence / Agile Methods

   This is the third test in our series of weekly quizzes. This week's
   questions are based on the lectures on "decision intelligence" and
   "agile [project] management". Several questions come with feedback
   that you can see upon submission. The tests themselves are not
   graded but the questions may be featured in the final exam. You can
   play them an unlimited number of times. Enjoy!

*** How do you approach difficult texts? Pick the right order (from first to last)

    (1) Check abstract for relevance

    (2) Check conclusions for results

    (3) Check references for validity

    (4) Check methods for validity

    (5) Check limitations for bias

    (6) Check body of paper for details

*** What validates a publication (i.e. gives it value)?

    (1) Complete, consistently cited, recent references (+)

    (2) Quantitative data (+)

    (3) Illustrations, tables, graphs (+)

    (4) Clear structure and writing style (+)

    (5) Few grammatical errors and misspellings (+)

    (6) Author is an acknowledged expert (+)

    (7) High value place of publication (e.g. ranked scientific
    journal) (+)

    (11) Honest discussion of research bias (+)

    (8) More than one author is listed

    (9) Place of publication is in the US or in Europe

    (10) Titles are not too long

    (12) Written in English

*** The format for a "user story" to develop project tasks is: "Who wants what and why"

    (1) TRUE (+)

    (2) FALSE

*** Bring these sub-disciplines of "decision intelligence" in the right order (from least mature to most mature).

    (1) Data modeling (for database design)

    (2) Process modeling (for process management)

    (3) Data mining (for making sense of data sets)

    (4) Process mining (for process and optimize processes from event logs)

*** What are the challenges for non-agile project management methods (like "Waterfall")?

    (1) Project complexity, client communication, and team culture (+)

    (2) Project analysis, design, and testing

    (3) The whole process from requirements analysis to maintenance

    (4) Project management skills development

    (5) Digital tools and certificates

*** Who is your audience for the term essays?

    (1) Scientists

    No, though your essays, being IMRaD-structured, should be up to
    scientific standards regarding expression, validation, and quality
    of discussion.

    (2) Students (+)

    Yes. More specifically: students just like you, or rather as you
    were before you began to learn about your chosen topic to become
    experts. This also means that you can test your content on other
    students!

    (3) Experts

    No. Though experts can always learn more, and (being experts)
    learn faster, you do not have to take them into account directly.

    (4) Product Owner (+)

    Yes, because I've given you the task, so I am your direct customer
    while your student audience is your indirect (end) customer. Two
    of my special requirements: a literature review (of your research
    question), and a section on limitations (of your research).

*** Industry and science have the same need for validation and truth

    (1) TRUE (+)

    Yes! In fact, as discussed in class: the needs of industry
    (markets, companies, but also government agencies) are perhaps
    even more severe, because there isn't the same "honor code" that
    ties scientists together (or at least should), and commercial
    interests often don't take truth too seriously in the interest of
    a quick sale or annual results.

    (2) FALSE

    If you said false, you may have illusions about science, and/or
    about business. Perhaps because you cannot imagine business people
    leafing through long, boring papers (wrong!), or because you
    cannot imagine scientists caring about applicability (also
    wrong!).

*** Which ways are there to find a term essay topic?

    (1) Pick a chapter from "The Model Thinker" (+)

    Yes, chapters 5-29 are up for grabs. Many of these chapters are
    too densely written so you could use only half or a third of a
    chapter. If in doubt, check with me.

    (2) Research a recent scientific article (+)

    Yes! I selected several articles and copied them for you (see
    GitHub). But you could also find your own article. Understanding
    these, presenting the content in your own words, literature
    review, and creating a glossary are subtasks here. Check with me
    if in doubt.

    (3) Research practical modeling methods (+)

    Yes! There are many sources for that. I have copied and uploaded
    one from Shell (see GitHub), which contains 12 different, popular,
    modeling-based techniques to be explored and presented in more
    detail. Check with me if in doubt.

    (4) Pick a chapter from "Introduction to mathematical modeling" (+)

    Yes! This is for the more mathematically inclined students. Part 1
    is totally doable for anybody with a working knowledge of college
    algebra, calculus and probability theory. Check with me if in
    doubt.

    (5) Come up with your own topic and research it (+)

    Absolutely yes! More demanding but also perhaps more rewarding

*** Monte Carlo simulation is a technique to estimate the possible outcomes of an uncertain event

    (1) TRUE (+)

    (2) FALSE

    MC simulations are computational algorithms used to estimate the
    possible outcomes of uncertain (i.e. probabilistic, or stochastic)
    events by repeated random sampling. In class, I showed a typical
    "experiment", namely drawing a bead from a collection of beads
    with replacement.

*** How can you check if you did really understand a concept?

    (1) Create your own questions and tests (+)

    (2) Google the concept and compare your understanding with the results

    (3) Explain the concept to people of different ages (e.g. ages 5,
    20, 60) (+)

    (4) Explain the concept to family and friends (+)

    (5) Find and watch short YouTube videos explaining the concept

    (6) Write a summary about it in your own words (+)

** Update 2 September 2021

   For the "project canvas" exercise on Tuesday 7 Sept, please bring a
   research question for your essay. It doesn't have to be the final
   one.  Cheers and have a great long weekend! MB

** Submit ideas for your essay (1 Sep)

   Submit your ideas here as a comment on this post by Thursday,
   September 9, 9 AM. [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/mod482/blob/main/3_decision_intelligence/followup_08_31_2021.md][Check the August 31 follow up]] for suggestions:
   there is a raft of useful, short modeling-focused articles in
   there, which you can take as the starting point for your essay.

   Put the tentative *title* of your essay topic (or topics, if there
   are several you're thinking about) into the subject line.  In the
   body of your post, put *references* and *thoughts* (e.g. why you
   want to present this topic - what motivates you), or *concerns*
   (e.g. difficulties that you expect).  References (literature,
   sites, blogs, personal communications etc.) are most important if
   you have them, because they help to validate the topic.

   Your topic should have DATA available, it should be DOABLE (not too
   big, not requiring expertise you don't have), you should already
   have some KNOWLEDGE (i.e. use what you already know or have
   learnt), and you should be MOTIVATED to research them.

   You'll briefly present your topic based on this information in
   class, followed by a short discussion. For this first sprint
   review, you don't have to follow the usual rules ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.md#org4966486][see FAQ]]) yet.

   Challenge: fill in the literature review list [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/Systematic_Literature_Review_Example_Table.docx][using this template]]
   and attach it to your submission - 5 sources minimum! Details in
   class.

*** Next Week's Must Do's

    By *Thursday, September 9*: identify an essay topic and post it in
    the [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/mod482/discussions/2][discussion forum]]. Remember the two reasons why this will work
    out: (1) we're using agile project management (Scrum) to
    incrementally improve your work, and (2) you're using IMRaD to
    structure your essay.

*** Who is your audience, and how should you address them?

    Your audience is a student like yourself - or rather, who you were
    before you wrote the essay. You should strive to explain things
    simply, using examples, but not shy away from math if
    necessary. You should quantify, use or create graphical
    illustrations when possible, instead of only write text.

    I'm your customer (Scrum product owner), but I'm commissioning you
    to write this essay for students. Don't try to write it for me,
    though of course remain aware that I'll also be reading the essay,
    especially with regard to formal criteria (spelling, references,
    structure etc.) and with respect to your anchoring your topic in
    current literature. This means that every essay must have a
    literature review section, no matter how short.

*** Ways to find a topic for your scientific essay

**** Using a chapter from THE MODEL THINKER
     Any of the chapters 5-29 would be a great choice for an
     essay. We'll cover chapters 1-4 in class based on my
     (rudimentary) lectures.

     The chapters are suitable, because they mostly deliver only a
     high level overview, coupled with a few examples. Details of
     the examples are usually contained in the endnotes. None of the
     chapters presume that you've read the entire book - you can
     pretty much jump in anywhere you like (though, of course, the
     more you've read the deeper your understanding).

     When you pick a chapter, you could bring your own special
     skills to it, and your own experience.

     There's no problem if two or more students pick the same topic:
     the chapters are very densely written and can easily be spread
     out over several short essays. However, whoever has similar
     topics needs to negotiate topic boundaries with me and with one
     another.

     Let's look at an example briefly. A student picked the chapter
     17, "Markov Models". These are models that represent state
     transitions, usually between equilibrium states (when, at least
     for a while, nothing changes). Later in the chapter, you read
     that Markov models were used to create Google's original PageRank
     search algorithm. This is quite literally the corner stone of the
     wealth of one of the most valuable companies on Earth today. The
     description in the book is very dense- and worth researching in a
     short essay. The research question of such an essay could be "How
     were Markov models used to create Google's PageRank search
     algorithm?" There is likely a myriad of articles dealing with
     this issue already - you will have to check it out and chart your
     own learning course.

     Markov models are also highly relevant in cybersecurity and
     network analysis ([[markov14][Abraham and Nair, 2014]]). If that's something
     that interests you, this could be your example, or one of your
     examples to illustrate the use of these models.

     The more mathematical models, or those dealing with algorithms,
     may be more suitable if you have a mathematical mind. If you're
     interested in applications and business, focus on that. If you're
     into programming and computing tech, go there. Some chapter are
     philosophical and deal with difficult questions of ethics etc.

     Whatever you pick, make sure that you don't start from a zero
     baseline, i.e. assuming nothing. Use the fact that you are seniors
     and show off what you already know - stats, algorithms, design,
     whatever.

**** Research a topic based on a scientific article

     As promised, here are a few recent, not too difficult
     articles. They're all from the Communications of the ACM, dealing
     with different aspects of data modeling, about 10 pages
     long[fn:9]. These articles aren't hard to read or understand, but
     they are overview articles without too much detail, written for
     members of the ACM (computer scientists or engineers). They don't
     contain too much theory, so this is something that you could
     add. For an essay on any of these topics, you can use the article
     as a central reference, but you should also research the topic
     and find other sources, of course. If you follow the doi URL, you
     get to a page of the ACM Digital Library, where you can often
     find accompanying material like [[https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn0nrSd4xjjbIHhktZoVlZuj2MbrBBC_f][these YouTube videos]].

     I have not studied some of these articles in detail, but if
     needed, I'm happy to discuss them with you!  Here's to hoping
     that you'll become the experts on your chosen topics! Order:
     alphabetical.

     Unlike the book chapters, only one person should pick one of the
     articles for their essay - the topics are otherwise a little too
     narrow.

**** Researching practical modeling methods

     "Solving Messy Problems - A Guide to Problem-Structuring
     Techniques", is a guide developed at Shell in 1998. It lists
     twelve different, popular model-based techniques to tackle
     complex problems. The descriptions are extremely short - this was
     written for business practitioners by me and my team of strategic
     planners when I worked at Shell. Your essay could cover one of
     these, bring it into the present with examples and, possibly,
     some theory.

     Online: [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/144NOnTyv913QeN3QDGyxIoKMeoTECqJN/view?usp=sharing][GDrive.]]

**** An Introduction to Mathematical Modeling

     "Introduction to Mathematical Modeling" ([[bender2000][Bender, 2000]]) is a
     classic first published in 1978. Written for engineering
     students, it covers a lot of examples of modeling with
     mathematical methods, especially probability theory and
     calculus - suitable for a 1-year undergraduate course.

     All of part I could easily become part of an essay. Here you must
     be careful to not just repeat what Bender wrote, because he write
     very well. To turn this into an original essay, you have to go
     through the examples and make them your own for example by
     solving the problems at the end of each chapter. If you can solve
     (some of) them, you'll be on top of it. I might help with that
     and you're like to find solutions online somewhere, too.

     An example: chapter 5.2 covers "Monte Carlo Simulations", which
     you may already have come across in mathematics. This is
     especially for probabilistic models that cannot be analyzed
     analytically (i.e. there is no formula[fn:10]) but with high
     statistics, you can also use the method to "prove" probability
     problems.

     For example, the following two lines of R code simulate drawing
     one bead at random from a sample of five beads:

     #+begin_src R :session :results output
       ## define sample of beads - two red, three blue
       beads <- rep(c("red", "blue"), times = c(2,3))

       ## draw 1 bead from sample with replacement, repeat 10,000 times
       events <- replicate(10000, sample(beads,1))

       ## print relative probabilities of drawing blue vs red beads
       prop.table(table(events))
     #+end_src

     Here are the results:

     #+begin_example
     : events
     :   blue    red
     : 0.5936 0.4064
     #+end_example

     This is an analytically solvable problem, of course: as the
     number of draws gets larger, the estimates get closer to
     ~3/5=0.6~ and ~2/5=0.4~.

     Bender presents three different, interesting applications,
     simulating a doctor's waiting room, settling of suspended
     particles, and stream networks. They are worked through and
     illustrated, but you should express them in your own language,
     connect them with more current examples, and write some code of
     the type shown above.

*** Creating questions on what you've just learnt

    This sounds as difficult as it is! I did not mean for it to sound
    trivial, either. There are a few tricks though:

    * Begin with (technical) terms or concepts that you cannot define,
      and ask "what does this mean?"
    * Check out Internet sites like Quora, Stackoverflow, or Reddit
      for questions that others asked about the topic.
    * Post the topic to friends, colleagues or family and ask them
      what they'd like to know[fn:7].
    * Imagine having to explain the topic to a 5, a 10, a 15 and a
      20-year old person[fn:8].

   This is the second test in our series of weekly quizzes. This
   week's questions are based on the "What is Model Thinking?"
   sessions and lectures. We spent more time discussing than absorbing
   a lot of content, hence there are only a few questions, and a
   couple of them are essay questions. Unlike last week, this week's
   quiz comes with some feedback, and not all questions are multiple
   choice questions. Some of these are also quite difficult - I hope
   you like it!

*** Which of these criteria describe a complex system?

    * There is a great variety of variables (+)
    * The system is in a metastable equilibrium
    * Many of the variables cannot be observed directly (+)
    * Low uncertainty
    * High uncertainty (+)
    * Single cause and effect chain
    * No single cause and effect relationships (+)
    * Dynamically evolving variables (+)
    * Many static variables with complicated mathematical formulas

*** What are issue with modeling problems involving zombies?

    * There are no zombies
    * There are no real observable quantities (+)
    * It's not a phenomenological problem (+)
    * Not tractable (no internal logic)

*** Which of these are types of models?

    * Abstractions (+)
    * Experiments
    * Mathematical formulas
    * Mathematical analogies (+)
    * Metaphors (+)
    * Graphical illustrations
    * Numbers in tables

*** Which of these is a condition to use many models (rather than one only)?

    * The problems are separable (+)
    * The problems are complex
    * There are many variables
    * There are different approaches (+)
    * It's a problem with a high data volume (a lot of input)
    * There may be many patterns present (+)

*** Which categories do you need to describe the use of a model?

    * Type of problem or decision to be made (+)
    * Description of method or process (+)
    * Identifiable observables (variables) (+)
    * A model purpose (+)
    * A model outcome (+)
    * Input data (+)

*** Faith, thoughts or feelings cannot be modeled.

    * True (+)
    * False

*** A "supermodel" (like Heidi Klum) is not a model in the "model thinking" sense.

    * True
    * False (+)

*** Is the issue of "student debt" a complex problem or not? (write down your argument before answering).

    Feedback: I think it is complex - (1) polytelic = rational
    contradictory views ("loans must be paid of" vs. "loans should be
    cancelled") exist; (2) variables evolve dynamically - e.g. mean
    income levels, cumulative debt, number of students, cost of
    living, demographics etc. (3) No clear problem definition, or
    rather competing definitions depending on one's view of higher
    education (e.g. a right vs. a product); (5) no single cause and
    effect relationship: e.g. both debt cancellation, and debt
    continuation lead to different scenarios with different
    likelihoods.


*** Consider the recent resignation of Lyon's president. Was there an underlying model at work? Which one? If not, why not?

    Feedback: from what I could see, no formal model was applied or
    communicated. There was an (informal) evaluation of the positive
    vs. the negative consequences of a resignation. However, this was
    no complex, just a complicated (and potentially, for many
    involved, painful) problem. If there's a straightforward solution
    and if consent can be quickly reached, there is no need to apply
    models (except perhaps if the non-complex problem keeps
    recurring).

*** Maslow's "Hierarchy of Needs" model from 1970 is a many-model approach

    * True (+)
    * False

    Feedback: this hierarchical model indeed contains a number of
    different models - compare [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/mod482/raw/main/2_model_thinking/img/Maslow.jpg][the diagram]]: each level is characterized
    by a set of different variables, which are not trivially
    connected. Also, the different levels do not follow logically from
    another (at least not without additional, arguable assumptions:
    e.g. you could argue that spiritual health is more important even
    than physiological health). The many-model approach of Maslow's
    hierarchy is unfortunately undeclared and unreflected. Making it
    obvious would allow reflection and optimization of the model.

*** "Essay" project process

    Three processes are aligned with one another for the project,
    which in this course is an essay ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/mod482/blob/main/syllabus.md#grading-system][cp. Syllabus]]):

    1) term: beginning mid August, ending in early December. Mid-term
       grades are independent of the project.
    2) Scrum: four sprints with four sprint reviews roughly four weeks
       apart. at a sprint review, you present the status of your essay
       prototype.
    3) IMRaD: the introduction with research question (what you wish
       to investigate), the method (how you are going to do it), your
       results (what you found out), and the discussion of your
       results (what it means, how it benefits whom, including the
       limitations of your investigation).

    In week 3 (Aug 30-Sep 3) we will focus on generating ideas and get
    the project set up properly (1st sprint review). [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.md][See also the FAQs]]

    * "What is a sprint review",
    * "What do I need to deliver at a sprint review?"
    * "What should we do in the first sprint?"
    * "What should we do in the second sprint?"
    * "What should we do in the third sprint?"
    * "What should we do in the fourth sprint?"

*** Maslow pyramid of needs

    This model by Maslow is so popular that it is often taken for
    truth. In fact, it is just a model, and not a timeless one. It is
    sometimes instructive to change a model to test its validity. For
    example, you could assume "spirituality" or "faith" as the basic
    need. Nothing stops you from doing that - and the model may now
    have more (or less) explanatory power.

*** Knowledge management model for Shell

    You can find this model and an explanation of what it was created
    for in an article that I wrote for the Univ of Auckland Business
    Review ([[birkenkrahe2002][Best paper, 2002]])

*** The Logic of Failure

    Dietrich Dörner is a theoretical (i.e. computational) psychologist
    from Bamberg University (Bavaria, Germany) and author of the
    influential book "The Logic of Failure" ([[dorner96][Dörner, 1997]]). See also:
    review ([[kirkus10][Kirkus, 2010]]).

    An article by [[dorner90][Dörner (1990)]] precedes the book and presents the
    main arguments with excellent illustrations - from the abstract:

    #+begin_quote
    "Unlike other living creatures, humans can adapt to
    uncertainty. They can form hypotheses about situations marked by
    uncertainty and can anticipate their actions by planning. They can
    expect the unexpected and take precautions against it. In numerous
    experiments, we have investigated the manner in which humans deal
    with these demands. In these experiments, we used computer
    simulated scenarios representing, for example, a small town,
    ecological or economic systems or political systems such as a
    Third World country.
    #+end_quote

    Here is the map of the fictitious town of Lohhausen, which Dörner
    simulated, followed by the system model used for the simulation.

    #+attr_html: :width 600px
    [[./img/lohhausen.png]]

    #+attr_html: :width 600px
    [[./img/lohhausen1.png]]

    I always find the very concept of a "logic of failure" quite
    puzzling - isn't logic independent of success or failure but
    describes just "what is"? The article's conclusions make it a
    little clearer, why he used the term "logic":

    #+begin_quote
    "It is possible to learn strategic flexibility. I believe,
    however, that it is difficult to teach it. It is not a matter of
    learning a few readily grasped general principles, but of learning
    a lot of small, 'local' rules, each of which is applicable in a
    limited area. The point is not to learn how to drive a steamroller
    with which one can flatten all problems in the same way, but to
    learn the adroitness of the puppeteer, who at one time holds many
    strings in his hands and who is able to adapt his movements to the
    given circumstances in the most sophisticated ways."
    #+end_quote

*** Complex systems

    Page (in The Model Thinker) mentions 'complexity' but does not
    define it except through examples. Dörner made an attempt at a
    definition, which we talked about it class (and applied it).

    * "A system is complex when it consists of a great variety of
      variables."
    * "All these variables are closely tied to one another, they
      mutually affect each other and constitute a network of
      independencies."
    * "The system is dynamic, which means that it develops further,
      even without interventions."
    * "The system is intransparent [because] many of the variables
      defy direct observation."
    * "The system is uncertain [because] the acting subject has no
      complete knowledge about the system, about its variables and
      their interdependencies."

      #+attr_html: :width 600px
      [[./img/moro.png]]

    To summarize: complex problems (in complex systems) mean

    1) large number of variables
    2) large network of interdependent variables
    3) dynamic evolution without intervention
    4) intransparency to direct observation
    5) great uncertainty due to incomplete knowledge

    The last criterion is actually more like a summary of the previous
    four, and it introduces the important term "uncertainty". Complex
    systems carry uncertainty, but not all uncertainty is due to
    complexity.

    For more details, see [[funke95][Frensch & Funke (1995)]] on complex problem
    solving.

*** Essay ideas

    There are a number of possible term essay topics:

    * "Complex problem criteria:" explore the issues of complex
      problem solving further. Are there different sets of criteria?
      Why is there a "European perspective" at all? When exploring
      concepts or criteria, always use (or create) examples.
    * "The Logic of Failure:" a book report or extended review,
      complete with applications to our time (the book is, after all,
      25 years old), might be very interesting. You could look for
      similar computer simulations, or even program one!
    * "List of models used to solve problem X:" we looked at a set of
      global complex problems. It might be interesting to compile a
      commented list of models used to tackle any of these problems.
    * "Local strategic rules:" what are these rules that Dörner talks
      about in the conclusions of his 1990 article, how would you
      validate his conjecture, and what is the relationship with
      many-model thinking?

** Msg to Nick Chaney (21 Aug)

   Hello Nick,

   I hope you are well. We've completed the first week pretty much
   only with orientation. If you accepted my invitation to the GitHub
   folder (https://github.com/birkenkrahe/mod482), you can look at the
   Syllabus, the orientation presentation (in [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/mod482/blob/main/1_overview/1_overview.md#orga55080b][1_overview]]), and the
   follow-up documents (session protocol).

   The only assignment for next week is to read the chapter
   "Many-model thinking" (see update message for how to get the text)
   for classroom discussion. At the start, there'll be a short test on
   last week's stuff, and I'll give a presentation on the topic of
   "decision intelligence" - an overview of the different tools of
   modeling and mining.

   Let me know if you have trouble with any of this.

   I hope this helps and I hope you can come back to class next
   week. Cheers, MB

*** Remember words and know concepts

    It may sound trivial and/or tedious to you, but knowing concepts
    and terms, and remembering them is better than having to look them
    up. Being able to look them up is, of course, better than not
    being able to do even that. Learning anything also consists of
    learning a certain number of technical terms. You've probably been
    brought up with Google search, instead of having to go to a book
    shelf or a library, or having to ask a real person. But Google
    does not replace own knowledge - information that you own, and
    that you know you own because you don't have to think twice if
    someone asks you. It is true that there is much less to learn by
    heart in STEM than, say, in poetry, or even in the life sciences
    or medicine. And in future, AI will likely be able to help you
    even more with remembering stuff. But core technical terms and
    concepts aren't just "stuff", they are like scaffold of ideas
    around which the regular stuff is only draped. One of my jobs as a
    teacher is to help you separate the stuff from the scaffold.

    For your presentation, projects, and all that, you need to do some
    semblance of research. When you do that, you should build a
    glossary of terms - definitions that you ideally craft
    yourself. You can also use these definitions in your writing and
    presenting (in other words: a good glossary is a valid research
    result). In fact, Wikipedia is nothing but a giant glossary.

    This is a long explanation why, at the start of a session, I ask
    you if you remember any words or concepts or ideas from the last
    session, and this challenge will also enter the weekly tests that
    you write in class to get back into the topic.

*** System sciences

    The Gestalt principle and many other theories and models -
    e.g. cybernetics, the science of control systems, the mother of
    computer science - are part of the "system sciences", the sciences
    that are concerned with general systems. Another, more current
    descendant is "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_science][design science]]", which has become a major modern
    research method in information systems. If you're interested, a
    seminal (highly readable) text on this field is "The sciences of
    the artificial" by one of the pioneers of AI ([[simon1996][Simon, 1996]]).

*** Communications of the ACM

    The Associations for Computing Machinery (ACM) founded in 1947 "is
    the world's largest scientific and educational computing society"
    ([[wikipedia][Wikipedia, n.d.]]). Its journal, the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_of_the_ACM][Communciations of the ACM]]
    (CACM) are of special importance to computer scientists or
    informatics people in training, because they are both scientific
    and rigorous, and readable. They're written, I think, primarily
    for professionals in the field, who want to keep abreast of new
    developments, and do not have the time to read a lot of current
    research literature. I appreciate the opinion pieces in CACM
    because they frequently deviate from mainstream views. When
    learning about a new topic, you should always check out CACM.

*** Burndown chart and Scrum
    This tool is perhaps the tool most often adopted by companies that
    use agile development or project management methods like Scrum. It
    is a true depiction of the state of the project: it displays the
    work still to be done vs. the work originally anticipated. The
    work itself is expressed in "story points" (tasks derived from
    so-called user stories, which we will also learn to create in this
    course). There is a close relationship with UML use-case
    diagrams. The graph illustrates the rationale behind working with
    agile methods: you'll be finished with all deliverables before the
    final exam time, and you have an opportunity to distribute your
    efforts equally across the whole term:

    [[./img/energy.jpg]]

*** Modeling languages and tools
    We'll encounter a few diagrammatic modeling languages, like:
    Event-controlled Process Chains (EPC), Business Process Model and
    Notation (BPMN), and Unified Modeling Language (UML). All of these
    have a mathematically exact origin in the so-called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_net][Petri nets]]
    used to model distributed systems of any kind. However, we will
    (for lack of time) not use them directly. If time permits, we'll
    also look at Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD), which is
    independent of Petri nets, and which is used to design relational
    databases. If I can pull of the deal, we'll be using Signavio by
    SAP for modeling. SAP is a German software company and the world's
    largest provider of so-called Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
    systems. The Signavio work place license is worth ca. US$ 100k per
    seat. Independent of this deal, we have free tools available, like
    UIPath (for Robotic Process Automation - RPA), or Celonis (for
    Process Mining).
*** References

    In this course, references must be consistent and complete. You're
    of course used to that from your liberal arts courses. Consistency
    means that you pick one citation style (I don't care which one) -
    e.g. [[https://apastyle.apa.org/][APA]]. If you use bibliographic software (like Mendeley, or
    Citavi, or Zotero), the software will help you pick a style and
    maintain consistency. Completeness means that every reference (no
    matter if you reference a personal communication, a blog, a book,
    an article, a web page, an image etc.) must have: author, date,
    title and place of publication (no matter if any of these are
    missing - then you should indicate that they're missing). A URL or
    link is not a complete reference (in fact, it's nothing, certainly
    not a place of publication). Partly because you're also liberal
    arts people, I pull no punches in this area and I'll mercilessly
    mark you down for violations of this rule ("consistency and
    completeness"), which may appear formal to you, but which is super
    important, especially in our times of relentless abuse and
    ignorance of intellectual property rights! End of rant!

** Follow-up  17 Aug

   I write a follow-up whenever I said stuff, or put stuff on the
   board that emerged during a session. I upload it to GitHub where
   you can comment, ask further, remind me of something I promised and
   forgot, or raise any other issue. This may show up in the weekly
   tests (and then also in the final exam, which is sourced from the
   tests). I'll demonstrate GitHub and how to work with it in the
   first week.

   Don't worry about the amount (or type) of information contained
   herein: I write these things up partly for myself, and partly for
   those interested, but I don't expect you to learn or know them at
   any point during this class. And I'll cease writing them up when I
   run out of time, which I often do towards the end of term.

   As part of your term project, you will come across a lot of new
   technical terms. To sort through them, you'll need to create a
   glossary. These follow-ups are my glossary for the course.

   ([[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rTELJCyH9nvk4zynuzOyWztCVxWOwuta?usp=sharing][Whiteboard]])

*** "Kabelsalat"
    German for "cable spaghetti". No need to know that!
*** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model][The Ising model]]
    The model was actually developed at the University of Hamburg
    where I studied physics, too. My [[http://www-library.desy.de/diss96.html][diploma (Master) thesis]] was
    concerned with counting graphs on a 4-dimensional hypercubical
    lattice. Such lattices can be used to simulate quantum field
    theories. This was a pretty difficult time for me, partly for
    personal, partly for professional reasons (I may say more in
    class), and it also was a difficult political time (the Berlin
    wall was opened that winter). The 4d Ising model has not been
    solved analytically (neither has the 3d model).
*** Social network analysis
    This is an active area of research (cp. [[crane18][Crane, 2018]]). It is
    linked to a number of different mathematical and computational
    disciplines, like graph theory (e.g. to classify and count the
    number of nodes and connections in a network), probability theory
    (esp. combinatorics and statistics), and databases (to store
    network information, much of which is unstructured, one can use
    so-called graph databases like [[https://neo4j.com/sandbox/][~neo4j~]]). Social networks are
    especially intriguing because of the rich interactions between
    network members (compared to e.g. a parallel computing network),
    and because of the Big Data that are generated.
*** Parametrization
    We briefly discussed a paper called "Predicting Tie Strength With
    Social Media" ([[gilbert09][Gilbert and Karahalios, 2009]]). I recommend that you
    take a look at this paper - it's relevant and readable even for
    beginners. When reading research papers, keep my FAQ "[[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.md#org1c34cd3][How should
    you read?]]" in mind. The paper parametrizes social media data for
    analysis: this means that the researchers identified many
    different variables in order to characterize tie strength. The ACM
    website for the article also comes with a [[https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1518701.1518736][video]] of the original
    presentation of the paper - worth checking out for curiosity!
*** Incubator
    An incubator is a place to grow startup businesses. It can be run
    by, or near a school or business - e.g. in the case of my last
    university, the incubator was housed in a large old factory
    building owned by SIEMENS and supported by it. Startups are like
    hatchlings, they need a lot of tender love and care to make it
    (and most don't nevertheless, in fact) - and money, usually
    provided by venture capitalists. Marc Andreessen is one of the
    most influential venture capitalists - he was also one of the
    creators of the first web browser ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)][Mosaic]] - then a start-up, or
    rather a spin-off, of a National computing center in Illinois).
*** Agile methods
    "Kanban" is the Japanese word for "sign". It stands for a simple
    "agile" method (in the technical sense) of organizing tasks on a
    board using post-its or other means. An app that implements the
    Kanban principle for private users is Trello. Kanban boards -
    often analog rather than digital - are common in production
    (e.g. to keep an overview of warehouse stock). In the course, you
    will use the agile method "Scrum" for your project work. Agile
    methods are widely used in industry and software engineering.
*** Multigrid methods
    Many physical systems exhibit symmetries - this means that under
    symmetry operations, the system behaves invariantly (it does not
    change). Imagine a vector in 2d-space: it is invariant against
    any non-rotational movements: length and angle remain the
    same. Symmetry operations often form mathematical groups. One of
    these groups is the renormalization group (RG). It is used in
    quantum field theory to describe the scaling behavior of quantum
    fields. Recently, it has also be used in connection with [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06157][neural
    nets and machine learning]]. But to exploit these symmetries for
    large-scale numerical computations requires algorithmic tricks -
    the multigrid is one such trick - this is what I was researching
    for my PhD in computational mathematical particle physics. I was
    also taking care of a [[https://www.desy.de/user/projects/MG.html][virtual library]] for the development of
    these algorithms.
*** Somatization
    This stands for the human ability to express mental and emotional
    issues through the body. I gave an example from my own career that
    also lead me to coaching (because, as a young, inexperienced,
    nerdy team leader, I needed it), to psychotherapy. Psychotherapy
    is bigger than coaching, and usually reserved for the mentally
    challenged. Frankly, it's too difficult for me - coaching is
    not. Nevertheless, I trained in a few therapeutic disciplines,
    like Gestalt therapy, Psychodrama, and Client-centered therapy.
*** Gestalt
    "Gestalt" is the German word for "shape". It refers to what you're
    focusing on, e.g. when looking at [[http://www.myorganisationalbehaviour.com/wp-content/uploads/gestalt-figure-ground.jpg][this image]]: you either see the
    candelaber, or two heads opposite each other. In class, we looked
    at [[https://i.pinimg.com/originals/83/3f/34/833f346d8f26cc0f77417e4a97f49bce.jpg][this classic Gestalt image]] of two women. In therapy, you can
    use Gestalt as a systemic principle (that's an important concept
    for another post or even a lecture) to address people's issues
    when these issues are obstructed by other issues of little
    importance (much like one image is obstructed by the other). Short
    story: in life, as in computing or math, success often depends on
    what you focus on!
*** Scenario method
    This is an important method (in strategic planning) that I may
    present in class, and then we may also do some exercises on
    it. For now, I only drew two orthogonal axes - soft vs. hard
    problems, and liberal arts vs. STEM solutions. Depending on the
    problem/solution pair, you can now place prominent problems in a
    quadrant. For example, the "consciousness" problem is a soft
    problem, because consciousness is not (yet) a measurable quality
    (not even as a binary quality - we don't know if animals are
    conscious, or not, though some of them, think of dolphins, seem
    that way). It is addressed more often than not by fields in the
    liberal arts, e.g. psychology (see, however, this talk by [[penrose17][Penrose,
    2017]]). "Commerce" is also soft, in that it is only indirectly
    measurable (if at all), and therefore hard to plan, and it is
    addressed e.g. by machine learning methods, which are
    STEM. However, all these big ticket items are in practice tackled
    by interdisciplinary sciences - e.g. "business informatics" (the
    field I taught in Germany) for commerce, or "cognitive sciences"
    for consciousness. I only came up with this on the day before our
    lecture, and I thought it would be fun to show on the first day!

** Meeting notes Friday September 3, 2021

   I'm just going to put these out if there's anything worth
   remembering or following up that we discuss in the meetings.

   Today, there were a few technical things that I learnt or had an
   opportunity to mention:

   * [[https://jenzabar.com/about][Jenzabar]] - "Higher Education Software Solution", self-described
     as a "CRM for Higher Education". This seems to be a portal for
     running university administration. The founders are former
     strategy/HR consultants. I had never heard of them.
   * [[https://www.drupal.org/][Drupal]] - like Joomla, Typo3, this is a modular open source CMS
     that you can use to create your own e-learning platform (like
     Moodle, or Schoology, or Sakai), or for an e-commerce
     shop. Markets itself now as a "digital experience platform"
     (whatever that's suppose to mean).
   * VPN, ssh - different network technologies to enable remote
     connections. VPN is much more complex, ssh is fairly simple. I
     might talk about these in my operating system course (Spring 22).
   * PXE (pronounced "pixie"), or Preboot eXecution Environment
     describes a client-server environment that boots, installs and
     deploys a client's OS remotely using DHCP and TFTP
     protocols. It's part of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface
     ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface][UEFI]]) that replaces the legacy BIOS (Basic Input Output System)
     originating from IBM PCs. It allows remote diagnostics and repair
     of computers without an OS installed.

* Footnotes

[fn:13]Presenting is an art all by itself. It's not usually part of
the computer science training but it is superbly important on the
job. To be able to present your results effectively is also an
important data science skill.

[fn:12] In the 1960s and 70s there was a saying "don't trust anyone
above 30". I'm arguing for the opposite here.

[fn:11] I have it on blueray disc - when this term is over, perhaps we
should put on an "AI movie night", whaddayathink?

[fn:10]I first come across Monte Carlo simulations in particle
physics: the analysis of particle accelerator experiments is entirely
probabilistic, and MC simulations are used to analyze the results of a
very large number of particle events. At the time, I was fairly young
and ignorant and I thought this was complete magic!

[fn:9]I found these, by the way, via a simple search on a science
library database in Germany that you don't have access to, hence I
copied them to my GDrive (as a matter of fair educational use).

[fn:8]This is a format that WIRED magazine developed, check out this
video ([[wired18][WIRED, 2018]]). I once (as a 22-year-old) spent an entire 8-hour
train ride from Hamburg to Munich in Germany explaining particle
physics to an elderly lady. It really showed me what I did, and what I
did not know (yet).

[fn:7]Since everybody is an expert on something else, you'll be
surprised about the questions that you get. They can be quite
hard. Even a question like "how would this benefit me?" can be
enlightening because you may never have thought about it for that
person, who might be a cop, a plummer, an actor or a librarian.

[fn:6]Google Adwords is a pay-per-click live auction advertising
program where the ads are free but Google charges for clicks on your
ad. It's an auction because click prices are determined by the amount
of competition ([[freshbooks][source]]).

[fn:1]In the 1960s, fuelled by Chomsky's studies, it was believed that
there was a universal grammar of all languages. Figuring it out meant
that one could, for example, build an automatic translator
easily. This formalization of language has since turned out to be a
complete dead-end street. A few years ago, Chomsky and other prominent
linguists admitted that there were today, more than 50 years later,
still had no clue what language really is or where it came from
([[hauser14][Hauser et al, 2014]]).

[fn:4]Another useful search engine is ScienceDirect - not for
preprints but for properly published scientific articles and
books. See for example the result for "[[https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/turing-test][Turing Test]]".

[fn:5]This protocol is an example protocol to see how it could be
done. However, you should feel free to define your own format - the
simple instruction is to reflect upon a classroom session and submit
the protocol within one week from the session. The protocol does not need to be complete, or
elegant, or have any particular length. You can put a lot or little
time into it. Your effort will or course be reflected in the
grade. The mandatory protocol makes up 15% of your grade. For
additional protocols, you can get extra credit.

[fn:3] Though there are isolated achievements of AGI, like when a
machine (Deep Blue) beat the world chess champion, Gary Kasparov, or
when the IBM Watson won Jeopardy!, or when Google's Alpha Go beat the
best Go player in the world.

[fn:2]This way of updating the code is not, of course, in the spirit
of version control. It would be better if every collaborator created a
branch of the file, updated it, and merged it with the original. In
this way, the software would take over highlighting of conflicts etc.x
