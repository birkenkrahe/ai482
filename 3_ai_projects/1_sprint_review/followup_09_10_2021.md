# Followup 1st Sprint Review Sept 10

![img](./img/rugby.gif)


## Presentations in general

Kudos for the three excellent presentations on Friday morning. I
was impressed with the results. This was our 10th meeting - only 30
more to go!

Key points to remember<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>:

1.  Bullet point lists should be ordered (take control of how the
    audience sees your content, and what they engage with)
2.  Slides should have limited information on them. Limit text
    elements.
3.  Push yourself to provide illustrations, graphs. Analytical
    audiences are especially grateful if you feed their hunger for
    accuracy and validation.
4.  Whenever you quantify, make sure to provide relative numbers and
    sufficient information to place the numbers in the appropriate
    context.

A few teams have not uploaded their presentations yet. Please do,
and let me know if you want to get feedback on it. Those who didn't
submit/present are first in line for the 2nd sprint review whose
focus is on methodology. However, you need to take the first step
(research question and literature review) before the second. 


## Sprint review presentations

I will leave comments on individual projects in the discussion
forum, especially if I come across interesting sources. As a
participant, you can opt to unsubscribe from the forum at any

### Sonny and Dat - Genetic algorithms

I'm not sure if AIMA references "ScienceDirect", an aggregator of
many freely available science articles and books, by reputable
science publisher Elsevier. This is often the first place I go to
for a research overview. You can also set an alert here, like at
scholar.google.com, but the return is more specific and relevant:
[Genetic Algorithm at ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/genetic-algorithm).


### Spencer and Jacob - Face recognition

I found an interesting blog post [here](http://www.bnosac.be/index.php/blog/89-human-face-detection-with-r) with a short coding example
that I believe is within your reach. There's also a link to an
entire course on "[Computer vision with R and Python](https://lstat.kuleuven.be/training/coursedescriptions/ComputervisionwithRandPython)" from an
excellent Belgian university (KU Leuven).


### Hakeem - Sports performance

At least three others, Emma and Fortunato (soccer players), and
Malcolm (football), are also intereste in AI and sports. Malcolm
also submitted a sprint review. You could even form one team of 4
people if you wanted to, or two teams of two - I leave it to
you. It can be an advantage to be in a team with people you
already know.


# Footnotes

<sup><a id="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> Presenting is an art all by itself. It's not usually part of
the computer science training but it is superbly important on the
job. To be able to present your results effectively is also an
important data science skill.
