## This Week's Must Do's

1.  By Wednesday: identify a (solo) presentation topic and post it
    in the [discussion forum](https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/discussions/4).
2.  By Friday: find a team - 2-3 people with whom to work on the AI
    application challenge prepare for and present at the sprint
    reviews (see [schedule](https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/blob/main/schedule.md)).


## Creating questions on what you've just learnt

This sounds as difficult as it is! I did not mean for it to sound
trivial, either. There are a few tricks though:

-   Begin with (technical) terms or concepts that you cannot define,
    and ask "what does this mean?"
-   Check out Internet sites like Quora, Stackoverflow, or Reddit
    for questions that others asked about the topic.
-   Post the topic to friends, colleagues or family and ask them
    what they'd like to know<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>.
-   Imagine having to explain the topic to a 5, a 10, a 15 and a
    20-year old person<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>.

# Footnotes

<sup><a id="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> Since everybody is an expert on something else, you'll be
surprised about the questions that you get. They can be quite
hard. Even a question like "how would this benefit me?" can be
enlightening because you may never have thought about it for that
person, who might be a cop, a plummer, an actor or a librarian.

<sup><a id="fn.2" href="#fnr.2">2</a></sup> This is a format that WIRED magazine developed, check out this
video ([WIRED, 2018](#orgc3829da)). I once (as a 22-year-old) spent an entire 8-hour
train ride from Hamburg to Munich in Germany explaining particle
physics to an elderly lady. It really showed me what I did, and what I
did not know (yet).
