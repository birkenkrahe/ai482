* Footnotes

[fn:2]The relationship between AI and ML is briefly explained in AIMA
at the start. Part V of the book deals exclusively with machine
learning. The distinctions (data science, AI, machine learning) are
not precise at all though.

[fn:3]We discussed some of them in class. Some issues were also
mentioned by Andrew Ng: data validation and availability; change
management (for deployment); scaling; value identification;
maintenance/debugging.

[fn:1](1) Predicting final grades from midterm and other student
performance data. (2) Predicting how much/which products a customer
will buy depending on his purchasing history. (3) Predicting if a
customer will buy or bail. (3) Predicting if email is spam or not. (4)
Predicting if an image is a cat or dog (or neither).
