** Can computers learn language? (2019)

   In 2019, my sister, who is a professor of linguistics at West
   Chester U., asked me to talk to her students about NLP. This is
   when I began to get interested in it. The [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/blob/main/10_ai_natural_language/can_computers_learn_languages.xmind][mindmap]] and [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/blob/main/10_ai_natural_language/can_computers_learn_languages_notes.pdf][lecture notes]]
   for this talk are in GitHub, and here is a [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/blob/main/10_ai_natural_language/can_computers_learn_languages.png][large screenshot]] for
   download[fn:8].

   This is also when I realized what a mess NLP was and how incomplete
   our understanding of perhaps our most privileged ability, language,
   stil is!

** OpenAI codex: automatic coding

   *Assignment:* To get going, watch 5 minutes of this video (from [[https://youtu.be/ISa10TrJK7w?t=115][here]]
   to [[https://youtu.be/ISa10TrJK7w?t=367][here]]) - recent coding successes with AI using natural language
   ([[neurapod][Neura Pod, 2021]]).

   The video reveals a particular (not uncommon) form of bias of what
   AI can and should do for us. It is contained in this quote:

   #+begin_quote
   "Programming is two things - one is: understand your problem. That
   includes talking to your users, thinking super hard about it,
   decomposing it in smaller pieces - these are the really cognitive
   aspects of building something. And then there's a second piece,
   which is: map a small functionality to code, whether it's an
   existing or an existing function, whether it's in your own codebase
   or out there in the world. And this second part is where the model
   really shines, like, I think it's better than I am at it, because it
   really has seen the whole universe of how people use code
   [...[fn:4]]. It really accelerates me as a programmer, and takes
   away the boring stuff so I can focus on the fun ones."
   #+end_quote

   I just got into the GitHub Copilot beta pilot for OpenAI Codex -
   will report if I learn anything![fn:5]

   |-------------------------------+----------------+----------------|
   | Machine translation           | Deep learning  | Learning agent |
   | Virtual assistants (chatbots) | Decision trees | Utility-based  |
   | Sentiment analysis            | Classification | Model-based    |

** Machine translation messing up

   /Image: Google translate messing up.[fn:6]/

   This is even worse - ~deepl~ is often really good when it comes to
   longer texts, but as a machine it is more on its own than Google
   Translate.

** NLP methods summary

   | METHOD                   | DEFINITION             | EXAMPLE                                           |
   |--------------------------+------------------------+---------------------------------------------------|
   | Tokenization             | Breaking strings up    | ~"the" "boy's" "cars" "are" "different" "colors"~ |
   | Stemming                 | Identifying word stems | ~"car" "cars" "car's" "cars'"~: ~car~             |
   | Lemmatization            | Morphological analysis | ~"am" "are "is"~: ~be~                            |
   | Part of speech tagging   | Syntactic analysis     | ~Time flies like an arrow.~                       |
   | Named Entity Recognition | Text labelling         | Label token ~Arizona~ as ~US state~               |

   Result of stemming and lemmatization ([[irb][Manning et al, 2008]]):
   |"the boy's cars are different colors"|~the boy car be differ color~|

   | Time flies like an arrow | (1) Time is like an arrow, in that it passes fast             |
   |                          | (2) "Time flies" (as in "fruit flies") like [to eat] an arrow |

  For this lecture, I have merely extracted what I think are the most
  interesting features of this chapter. Overall, it gives a fair
  impression of the state of the art without getting bogged down in
  technical detail (true to the expected non-technical business
  audience).

** Measuring language complexity

   | METRIC        | TARGET                   | ORIGIN           | METAPHOR    |
   |---------------+--------------------------+------------------+-------------|
   | Width         | volume of the vocabulary | domain diversity | crown width |
   | Depth         | levels of understanding  | domain depth     | tree height |
   | Width x Depth | complexity of patterns   | uses of language | tree cover  |

   #+attr_html: :width 600px
   [[./img/nlp.png]]

   Greater area corresponds to greater "complexity"[fn:10].

   #+attr_html: :width 400px
   [[./img/nlp1.png]]

   /What is for example not captured with this measure?/[fn:9]

   Two application examples:

   | Application                          | Depth                                  | Width                         |
   |--------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+-------------------------------|
   | Sentiment analysis on tweets         | low: positive or negative review label | high: many different subjects |
   | Classifying customer support tickets | high: many different support types     | low: all tasks in one domain  |

** NLP application scenarios

   #+attr_html: :width 400px
   [[./img/nlp2.png]]

   This is a bit of a downer but not surprising: the application of
   machine "intelligence" is a function of our understanding of an
   entity. In the case of natural (i.e. human) language, this
   understanding is not forthcoming:

   #+begin_quote
   "In the last 40 years, there has been an explosion of research on
   [the] problem [of language evolution] as well as a sense that
   considerable progress has been made. We argue instead that the
   richness of ideas is accompanied by a poverty of evidence, with
   essentially no explanation of how and why our linguistic
   computations and representations evolved." ([[hauser][Hauser et al, 2014]]).
   #+end_quote

   However, notice advances with rational agents despite our inability
   to understand, or define, human intelligence (which is an even
   larger canvas than language).

   Also, understanding of the "evolution of language" is not the same
   as understanding of language. Another possibility is here that our
   understanding of evolution as a concept (or theory) is incomplete
   or erroneous. Cp. [[wolfe][Wolfe (2016)]] for some heretic thoughts on the
   matter.

** Sentiment analysis and autonomous spam detection

   * Classification problems
   * Statistical method: naive Bayes[fn:11]
   * "Learning by experience beats hand-coded rules"

   #+attr_html: :width 400px
   [[./img/sentiment.png]]

** Text classification and document search and retrieval

   This NLP workflow diagram includes some of the tools explained
   earlier, showing the transfer from model training to deployment.

   #+attr_html: :width 400px
   [[./img/pipe.png]]

   For document search, documents are looked up that have similar
   embeddings as the query. The model is trained on existing
   documents.

   #+attr_html: :width 400px
   [[./img/search.png]]

   Success depends on the accuracy of the embeddings (the labelling
   for training and testing). An important technical detail is
   reduction of dimensions - the longer the embedding information
   vector the better the search but the worse the algorithm performs.

   Popular methods to achieve this reduction are [[https://www.displayr.com/singular-value-decomposition-in-r/][Singular Value
   Decomposition (SVD)]] and [[https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/pca-analysis-r][Principal Component Analysis (PCA)]][fn:13].

** Natural conversation and transformer models

   * GPT-3 powers fast apps like [[viable][~viable~]] ([[https://askviable.com/][1 min video]])
   * GPT-3 does not really understand what it's saying
   * GPT-3 can get stuck on a loop or produce gibberish
   * Probabilistic reasoning is not the same as understanding

*** Insight generation with Viable

    #+begin_quote
    Using GPT-3, Viable identifies themes, emotions, and sentiment
    from surveys, help desk tickets, live chat logs, reviews, and
    more. It then pulls insights from this aggregated feedback and
    provides a summary in seconds.

    For example, if asked, “What’s frustrating our customers about the
    checkout experience?”, Viable might provide the insight:
    “Customers are frustrated with the checkout flow because it takes
    too long to load. They also want a way to edit their address in
    checkout and save multiple payment methods.” (Source: [[gpt3][OpenAI]])

    | MIT team analyzed different language models (incl. GPT-3[fn:12])                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
    | "Best-performing next-word prediction models activity patterns resemble those seen in the human brain."                                                                                                                                                                                       |
    | "We found that the models that predict the neural responses well also tend to best predict human behavior responses, in the form of reading times. And then both of these are explained by the model performance on next-word prediction. This triangle really connects everything together." |

    #+attr_html: :width 600px
    [[./img/mit.png]]

    #+begin_quote
    "One of the key computational features of predictive models such
    as GPT-3 is an element known as a forward one-way predictive
    transformer. This kind of transformer is able to make predictions
    of what is going to come next, based on previous sequences. A
    significant feature of this transformer is that it can make
    predictions based on a very long prior context (hundreds of
    words), not just the last few words.

    Scientists have not found any brain circuits or learning
    mechanisms that correspond to this type of processing, Tenenbaum
    says. However, the new findings are consistent with hypotheses
    that have been previously proposed that prediction is one of the
    key functions in language processing, he says."

** Case study: Translated

   #+begin_quote
   "Lok at the tasks that a company could perform using 1,000
   untrained interns. These are tasks that can be automated by AI."
   (Trombetti in [[zero2ai][Zero to AI]], p. 118)
   #+end_quote

   ~Translated~ uses AI for binary classification of documents...

    #+attr_html: :width 600px
    [[./img/t1.png]]

    ...but also to match customers and translators (greater depth)...

    #+attr_html: :width 600px
    [[./img/t2.png]]

    ...and to improve translations in concert with humans (greater
    width):

    #+attr_html: :width 600px
    [[./img/t3.png]]

* Questions for discussion

  * How does (the idealized) BrokerBot differ from (the implemented)
    Eliza, the therapist bot?
  * Can the different AI applications of the ~Translated~ case study
    be transferred to other industries besides translation?
  * What stops us from getting better at Natural Language Processing?

* Footnotes

[fn:13]The links go to two articles on doing this stuff using the
statistical programming language R. I prefer explaining and studying
these methods in concert with actual computations (instead of only
mathematically). However, if you can take the time, you should dive
into the mathematics, too (or suggest it as an example in a linear
algebra class).

[fn:12]"Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3" created by OpenAI
([[gpt3][2021]]).

[fn:11]Here is an [[https://youtu.be/Q8l0Vip5YUw][excellent video]] ([[serrano19][Serrano, 2019]]) explaining this
important statistical theorem about conditional probabilities. The
creator of the video has also just (Oct 21) published a well reviewed
book on machine learning (Serrano, 2021). You should also read the
original article by Paul Graham on spam detection ([[spam][2002]]).

[fn:10]In quotes because this is an almost trivial notion of
complexity. Compare it with the complexity defined by [[dorner][Dorner (1990)]] as
a function of dynamic variables.

[fn:9]Language ambiguities (overlaps). Different meaning as the result
of interaction (over time, space). Example: how language changes in
the course of a telephone conversation, a talk between lovers, or in
the course of a hostile company takeover or a conquest in war. More
generally, any features that cannot easily be captured with a feature
vector (e.g. because we don't even know what the variables are).

[fn:8]There is a fair amount of posturing in the notes and in the
talk, because my sister asked me to impress her students.

[fn:7]We've used this term "use case" in class without definition. In
the Unified Modeling Language (UML), a use case diagram shows all the
different ways in which a user might interact with a system. The more
colloquial use means that we look at all the different ways, in which
a concept might be applied or used.

[fn:6]Actually, "Du kannst mich mal gerne haben" (German) means "Bite
me."  While "jemanden gerne haben" means "to like someone", the
operational part of the German sentence is "Du kannst mich mal", which
is correctly machine translated as "Bite me." But the last part is
inserted to soften it (typically used like this in the South of
Germany).

[fn:5]"GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer which suggests line
completions and entire function bodies as you type. GitHub Copilot is
powered by the OpenAI Codex AI system, trained on public Internet text
and billions of lines of code." ([[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot][Source]]). Alas, I do not use Visual
Code Studio - an editor from Microsoft (now it makes sense why GitHub,
also owned by Microsoft, partners with OpenAI Codex - more customers
for both their platforms and ultimately for their cloud business,
Azure).

[fn:4]Using the GPT-3 model.

[fn:2]The relationship between AI and ML is briefly explained in AIMA
at the start. Part V of the book deals exclusively with machine
learning. The distinctions (data science, AI, machine learning) are
not precise at all though.

[fn:3]We discussed some of them in class. Some issues were also
mentioned by Andrew Ng: data validation and availability; change
management (for deployment); scaling; value identification;
maintenance/debugging.

[fn:1](1) Predicting final grades from midterm and other student
performance data. (2) Predicting how much/which products a customer
will buy depending on his purchasing history. (3) Predicting if a
customer will buy or bail. (3) Predicting if email is spam or not. (4)
Predicting if an image is a cat or dog (or neither).
