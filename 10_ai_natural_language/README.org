  *Assignment:* To get going, watch 5 minutes of this video (from [[https://youtu.be/ISa10TrJK7w?t=115][here]] to [[https://youtu.be/ISa10TrJK7w?t=367][here]]) -
  recent coding successes with AI using natural language ([[neurapod][Neura Pod,
  2021]]).

  The video reveals a particular (not uncommon) form of bias of what
  AI can and should do for us. It is contained in this quote:

  #+begin_quote
  "Programming is two things - one is: understand your problem. That
  includes talking to your users, thinking super hard about it,
  decomposing it in smaller pieces - these are the really cognitive
  aspects of building something. And then there's a second piece,
  which is: map a small functionality to code, whether it's an
  existing or an existing function, whether it's in your own codebase
  or out there in the world. And this second part is where the model
  really shines, like, I think it's better than I am at it, because it
  really has seen the whole universe of how people use code
  [...[fn:4]]. It really accelerates me as a programmer, and takes
  away the boring stuff so I can focus on the fun ones."

  * Which two metrics are used to measure NLP performance?
  * Why is sentiment analysis a classification problem?
  * What does OpenAI's GPT-2 model do?
  * How does BrokerBot differ from Eliza the therapist bot?

* Footnotes

[fn:4]Using the GPT-3 model. 

[fn:2]The relationship between AI and ML is briefly explained in AIMA
at the start. Part V of the book deals exclusively with machine
learning. The distinctions (data science, AI, machine learning) are
not precise at all though.

[fn:3]We discussed some of them in class. Some issues were also
mentioned by Andrew Ng: data validation and availability; change
management (for deployment); scaling; value identification;
maintenance/debugging.

[fn:1](1) Predicting final grades from midterm and other student
performance data. (2) Predicting how much/which products a customer
will buy depending on his purchasing history. (3) Predicting if a
customer will buy or bail. (3) Predicting if email is spam or not. (4)
Predicting if an image is a cat or dog (or neither).
