  *Assignment:* To get going, watch 5 minutes of this video (from [[https://youtu.be/ISa10TrJK7w?t=115][here]]
  to [[https://youtu.be/ISa10TrJK7w?t=367][here]]) - recent coding successes with AI using natural language
  ([[neurapod][Neura Pod, 2021]]).

  The video reveals a particular (not uncommon) form of bias of what
  AI can and should do for us. It is contained in this quote:

  #+begin_quote
  "Programming is two things - one is: understand your problem. That
  includes talking to your users, thinking super hard about it,
  decomposing it in smaller pieces - these are the really cognitive
  aspects of building something. And then there's a second piece,
  which is: map a small functionality to code, whether it's an
  existing or an existing function, whether it's in your own codebase
  or out there in the world. And this second part is where the model
  really shines, like, I think it's better than I am at it, because it
  really has seen the whole universe of how people use code
  [...[fn:4]]. It really accelerates me as a programmer, and takes
  away the boring stuff so I can focus on the fun ones."
  #+end_quote

  I just got into the GitHub Copilot beta pilot for OpenAI Codex -
  will report if I learn anything![fn:5]

* What will you learn?

  * What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?
  * How is NLP success measured?
  * What is sentiment analysis?
  * How are chatbots designed?

  | Use case[fn:7]                | Algorithm      | Agent type |
  |-------------------------------+----------------+------------|
  | Machine translation           |                |            |
  | Virtual assistants (chatbots) |                |            |
  | Sentiment analysis            | Classification |            |
  | Spam detection                | Classification |            |

  This is even worse - ~deepl~ is often really good when it comes to
  longer texts, but as a machine it is more on its own than Google
  Translate.

* Questions for discussion

  * Which two metrics are used to measure NLP performance?
  * Why is sentiment analysis a classification problem?
  * What does OpenAI's GPT-2 model do?
  * How does BrokerBot differ from Eliza the therapist bot?

* Footnotes

[fn:7]We've used this term "use case" in class without definition. In
the Unified Modeling Language (UML), a use case diagram shows all the
different ways in which a user might interact with a system. The more
colloquial use means that we look at all the different ways, in which
a concept might be applied or used. 

[fn:6]Actually, "Du kannst mich mal gerne haben" (German) means "Bite
me."  While "jemanden gerne haben" means "to like someone", the
operational part of the German sentence is "Du kannst mich mal", which
is correctly machine translated as "Bite me." But the last part is
inserted to soften it (typically used like this in the South of
Germany).

[fn:5]"GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer which suggests line
completions and entire function bodies as you type. GitHub Copilot is
powered by the OpenAI Codex AI system, trained on public Internet text
and billions of lines of code." ([[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot][Source]]). Alas, I do not use Visual
Code Studio - an editor from Microsoft (now it makes sense why GitHub,
also owned by Microsoft, partners with OpenAI Codex - more customers
for both their platforms and ultimately for their cloud business,
Azure).

[fn:4]Using the GPT-3 model.

[fn:2]The relationship between AI and ML is briefly explained in AIMA
at the start. Part V of the book deals exclusively with machine
learning. The distinctions (data science, AI, machine learning) are
not precise at all though.

[fn:3]We discussed some of them in class. Some issues were also
mentioned by Andrew Ng: data validation and availability; change
management (for deployment); scaling; value identification;
maintenance/debugging.

[fn:1](1) Predicting final grades from midterm and other student
performance data. (2) Predicting how much/which products a customer
will buy depending on his purchasing history. (3) Predicting if a
customer will buy or bail. (3) Predicting if email is spam or not. (4)
Predicting if an image is a cat or dog (or neither).
