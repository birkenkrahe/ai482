**Assignment:** To get going, watch 5 minutes of this video (from [here](https://youtu.be/ISa10TrJK7w?t=115) to [here](https://youtu.be/ISa10TrJK7w?t=367)) -
recent coding successes with AI using natural language ([Neura Pod,
2021](#orgaffcdae)).

The video reveals a particular (not uncommon) form of bias of what
AI can and should do for us. It is contained in this quote:

> "Programming is two things - one is: understand your problem. That
> includes talking to your users, thinking super hard about it,
> decomposing it in smaller pieces - these are the really cognitive
> aspects of building something. And then there's a second piece,
> which is: map a small functionality to code, whether it's an
> existing or an existing function, whether it's in your own codebase
> or out there in the world. And this second part is where the model
> really shines, like, I think it's better than I am at it, because it
> really has seen the whole universe of how people use code
> [&#x2026;<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>]. It really accelerates me as a programmer, and takes
> away the boring stuff so I can focus on the fun ones."

# Questions for discussion

-   Which two metrics are used to measure NLP performance?
-   Why is sentiment analysis a classification problem?
-   What does OpenAI's GPT-2 model do?
-   How does BrokerBot differ from Eliza the therapist bot?
