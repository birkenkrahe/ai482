**Assignment:** To get going, watch 5 minutes of this video (from [here](https://youtu.be/ISa10TrJK7w?t=115)
to [here](https://youtu.be/ISa10TrJK7w?t=367)) - recent coding successes with AI using natural language
([Neura Pod, 2021](#orgbfe8feb)).

The video reveals a particular (not uncommon) form of bias of what
AI can and should do for us. It is contained in this quote:

> "Programming is two things - one is: understand your problem. That
> includes talking to your users, thinking super hard about it,
> decomposing it in smaller pieces - these are the really cognitive
> aspects of building something. And then there's a second piece,
> which is: map a small functionality to code, whether it's an
> existing or an existing function, whether it's in your own codebase
> or out there in the world. And this second part is where the model
> really shines, like, I think it's better than I am at it, because it
> really has seen the whole universe of how people use code
> [&#x2026;<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>]. It really accelerates me as a programmer, and takes
> away the boring stuff so I can focus on the fun ones."

I just got into the GitHub Copilot beta pilot for OpenAI Codex -
will report if I learn anything!<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>

# What will you learn?

-   What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?
-   How is NLP success measured?
-   What is sentiment analysis?
-   How are chatbots designed?

# Questions for discussion

-   Which two metrics are used to measure NLP performance?
-   Why is sentiment analysis a classification problem?
-   What does OpenAI's GPT-2 model do?
-   How does BrokerBot differ from Eliza the therapist bot?

# Footnotes

<sup><a id="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> Using the GPT-3 model.

<sup><a id="fn.2" href="#fnr.2">2</a></sup> "GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer which suggests line
completions and entire function bodies as you type. GitHub Copilot is
powered by the OpenAI Codex AI system, trained on public Internet text
and billions of lines of code." ([Source](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot)). Alas, I do not use Visual
Code Studio - an editor from Microsoft (now it makes sense why GitHub,
also owned by Microsoft, partners with OpenAI Codex - more customers
for both their platforms and ultimately for their cloud business,
Azure).
