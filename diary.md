# What is this?

A place for irregular articles of possible interest to students of
the DSC 482.01 course, a special seminar on "Artificial
Intelligence", mostly to avoid lengthy emails and to park content
that I may want to develop later on, if I find the time.

# Friday, August 27 - Buns, Books, Games and the Arkansas Experience


## At the Salty Dog

After class today, I went over to the Salty Dog to treat myself to a
much-deserved cappuccino + cinnamon bun. This combo is excellent and
did much to improve my mood (which had already been good anyway).


## At the Library

Once the bun had been handed over to my abdomen, I headed to the
library to drink my coffee: the armchairs near the entrance are
fantastic<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. Since I was in a library, I put my phone away and
picked up a magazine. Guess what I found? An really interesting
article on AI: "Bot Doc", on a miniature surgical robot
([Feldman/Pratap, 2021](#org8d70cec)). [I took pictures](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pi3qw5vlkWoChkLqOwOTXOewcGJ2hXrc?usp=sharing) but, of course, to have the
full experience, you should go to the library! This is an example
for a new AI application that you could feature in a presentation
and/or for your own AI application project<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>.


## AI Books

You should do that in any case: they have a great collection of
books on AI. I really don't know why! The books are mostly dated,
but that does not matter so much. I borrowed two, which are
relevant to the next few weeks - "AI - A Philosophical
Introduction" ([Copeland, 1993](#org0c2074f)), by a professor of logic (now you
know in which quadrant of the graph we are, right?), and "Computers
and Thought" ([Feigenbaum/Feldman eds., 1963](#org6f58436)).

I had only been aware of one book on the philosophy of AI, by
H.L. Dreyfus, "What Computers Still Can't Do" ([1992](#org13811f1)), a pessimistic
account of the progress of AI since its beginnings. Here is a
conversation with Dreyfus on "why machines cannot become human."
([UCTV, 2008](#org33f6c26))<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>:

> "At a time when researchers were proposing grand plans for general
> problem solvers and automatic translation machines, Dreyfus
> predicted that they would fail because their conception of mental
> functioning was naive, and he suggested that they would do well to
> acquaint themselves with modern philosophical approaches to human
> beings. What Computers Can't Do was widely attacked but quietly
> studied. Dreyfus's arguments are still provocative and focus our
> attention once again on what it is that makes human beings unique."
> ([mitpress.edu](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/what-computers-still-cant-do))

"Computers and Thought" is a scientific monograph with articles by
some of the greats of the field - Turing (the article I already
recommended to you, from 1947), Simon, Newell (both creators of the
"General Problem-solver", another AI attempt in the logic quadrant
of our graph):

> "Computers and Thought showcases the work of the scientists who not
> only defined the field of artificial intelligence, but who are
> responsible for having developed it into what it is
> today. Originally published in 1963, this collection includes
> twenty classic papers by such pioneers as A. M. Turing and Marvin
> Minsky who were behind the pivotal advances in artificially
> simulating human thought processes with computers. Among the now
> hard-to-find articles are reports of computer programs that play
> chess and checkers, prove theorems in logic and geometry, solve
> problems in calculus, balance assembly lines, recognize visual
> temporal patterns, and communicate in natural language. The reports
> of simulation of cognitive processes include computer models of
> human behavior in logic problems, deciding on common stock
> portfolios, and carrying out social interaction. Models of verbal
> learning behavior, predictive behavior in two-choice experiments,
> and concept formation are also included." ([aaai.org](https://www.aaai.org/Press/Books/feigenbaum.php))

I'll dive into these over the weekend when I prepare my upcoming
lectures.


## Games industry in Arkansas?

I had a nice conversation with an internship student, who turned
out to like similar video games like I - the Dark Souls series, and
other titles. From what she told me, there may be quite a pool of
students at Lyon interested in video games. I'm inspired to think
about ways in which one could use this talent for a gaming industry
startup. This could be fun, and it could potentially be great for
Lyon and for Batesville. There already is a thriving esports
program at the college, and this might fit right in. Also: I need
to get my hands on a PS5!


## Community

On a losely related note: I got my Arkansas drivers license today!
Beginning to feel like a full member of this community. Also: very
impressed with the administrative processes all around. Getting
your license in Germany is a major headache. Weeks later, they send
it to you via surface mail. In Batesville, you present your
documents, do a visual test, and minutes later you walk out, a
freshly printed license and full ID in hand. It's a little like
moving from a Kafka novel into a story where suddenly everything
makes a little more sense.

# Footnotes

<sup><a id="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> In fact, a student had fallen asleep on a couch. He was cradling
his laptop. After a few minutes, he got up with the words: "I fell
asleep. What a bad idea." It reminded me of a visit in Paris when I
was 19 or so: there's a famous bookshop, Shakespeare's & Co, across
from the church Notre Dame. I used to go there late at night. The
upper stories had velvet-covered chaise longues. Once, after having
walked around in Paris for hours and hours, I was tired like a dog,
fell asleep on one of those couches, and awoke only on the next
morning: evidently, they had found me and let me sleep there.

<sup><a id="fn.2" href="#fnr.2">2</a></sup> The article contains a few medical terms that I did not know,
like "bariatric surgeon" and "laparoscopy". So much for having studied
Latin and Greek, I suppose. Where are the words when you need them?

<sup><a id="fn.3" href="#fnr.3">3</a></sup> The 1992 book is an update of the classic "What Computers Can't
Do" ([1972](#org6fd7f54)), which was the earliest philosophical attack on AI. Twenty years
later, the author remained unrelenting in his critique of AI. Dreyfus
and I share a love for the religious philosopher Soren Kierkegaard,
and an awe of the German phenomenologist Heidegger. Dreyfus' YouTube
lectures on these guys are pretty fascinating.
