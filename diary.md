# Friday, August 27 - Books and Games


## The Salty Dog

After class today, I went over to the Salty Dog to treat myself to a
much-deserved cappuccino + cinnamon bun. This combo is excellent and
did much to improve my mood (which had already been good anyway).


## The Library

Once the bun had been handed over to my abdomen, I headed to the
library to drink my coffee: the armchairs near the entrance are
fantastic<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. Since I was in a library, I put my phone away and
picked up a magazine. Guess what I found? An really interesting
article on AI: "Bot Doc", on a miniature surgical robot.[I took
pictures](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pi3qw5vlkWoChkLqOwOTXOewcGJ2hXrc?usp=sharing) but, of course, to have the full experience, you should go
to the library! This is an example for a new AI application that
you could feature in a presentation and/or for your own AI
application project.


# Footnotes

<sup><a id="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> In fact, a student had fallen asleep on a couch. He was cradling
his laptop. After a few minutes, he got up with the words: "I fell
asleep. What a bad idea." It reminded me of a visit in Paris when I
was 19 or so: there's a famous bookshop, Shakespeare's & Co, across
from the church Notre Dame. I used to go there late at night. The
upper stories had velvet-covered chaise longues. Once, after having
walked around in Paris for hours and hours, I was tired like a dog,
fell asleep on one of those couches, and awoke only on the next
morning: evidently, they had found me and let me sleep there.
