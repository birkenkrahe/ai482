** Finding a good man

   #+begin_quote

Finding a good man is like finding a needle in a haystack.

   #+end_quote

   #+begin_notes

*Highlighted:* Finding a needle in a haystack takes a long time, so the task at
hand is likely to be hard and tedious.

*Issues:* (1) If "finding a good man" is hard or not depends on
your view of men. My experience is that it is much harder to find a
"bad man". (2) Christians say that we're all fallen, i.e. bad to
begin with - which means that it is strictly impossible to find a
good man.

** Explaining a joke

   #+begin_quote

Explaining a joke is like dissecting a frog. You understand it
better but the frog dies in the process.

   #+end_quote

   #+begin_notes

(By E.B. White.) *Highlighted:* Sometimes it is better not to know
too much.

*Issues:* (1) that the animal dies when we dissect it, is
obvious. It may be a price we're willing to pay for the
knowledge. Killing frogs is not an issue for everyone. People have
died to gain knowledge - Marie Curie is a famous
example. Astronauts willing to go to space is another. (2)
Explaining a joke always happens outside of the joke itself. You
could argue that it does not destroy the joke (when it is told).

** Life is sweet

   #+begin_quote

Life is like a box of chocolates - you never know what you're going
to get.

   #+end_quote

   #+begin_notes

(Used in Forrest Gump.) *Highlighted:*

*Issues:* (1) This is trivially true if you've not made the
chocolates yourself. However, you don't know how it's going to
taste even if you made them. (2) Life is a lot more than that. And
if you make certain good or bad decisions, you can be more sure
what your life's going to be like. Life is not just handed to you
like a box of chocolates. (3) Life is not always sweet, chocolate
is.

** [[dict][The peanut analogy]]

   #+begin_quote

"Withdrawal of U.S. troops will become like salted peanuts to the
American public; the more U.S. troops come home, the more will be
demanded." - Henry Kissinger in a Memo to President Richard Nixon.

   #+end_quote

** [[terminator][The Terminator analogy]]

   #+begin_quote

“There are two doors. Behind door 1 is a completely sealed room,
with a regular, gasoline-fueled car. Behind door 2 is an identical,
completely sealed room, with an electric car. Both engines are
running full blast. I want you to pick a door to open, and enter
the room and shut the door behind you. [...] This is the choice the
world is making right now.”

** [[chamary][The Star Wars analogy]]

   #+begin_quote
   The Rebel Alliance is the human body and the construction crews are
   the protein-making machinery within cells. (Cp.[[starwars][xkcd cartoon]])
