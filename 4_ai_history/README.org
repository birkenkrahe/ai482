* Model thinking

Model thinking is a special way of looking at the world - through
models. We cover the first chapter of Page's book "The Model Thinker"
(Basic Books, 2021), and when I write 'cover', I mean use, expand and
critique. We look at complex problems (the interesting, brain-breaking
ones) and how an approach of many models may be more useful than a one
model approach (though this approach also has its validity).
