* History of AI

  AI as a systematic, scientific field of investigation dates back about
  80 years - the early 1940s. Its beginnings coincide with the
  beginnings of digital computing, which is not surprising.

  As you saw in the 1961 MIT film, computers and "thinking machines" are
  largely identified. Much of the history of AI since those early days
  has been about understanding the differences and similarities between
  computer science and AI.

  Quite early on, in the late 1950s, another term entered public
  consciousness (a superset of scientific consciousness, which is
  usually, but not always, and not by necessity, preceded by scientific
  consciousness): machine learning.

  The three terms on which the field of AI studies is founded are
  therefore: intelligence, thinking, and learning. We still don't know
  much by way of science about any of these[fn:1]. This could be one
  reason why AI in practice has gradually moved away from trying to
  imitate humans - the term 'learning' in 'machine learning' corresponds
  to only a barely visible fraction of the entire spectrum of human
  learning. It's really more of a brand label, and less of a meaningful
  attribute. The same could be said for the brand "AI" itself.

  This experience - not being able to make much use of humanity - has
  lead to AI as a discipline increasingly dominated by machines, and by
  machine-relevant things. Which is not bad in itself - many
  technological developments rely on inventors and practictioners
  getting very close to their contraptions and inventions: the
  development of engines, of cars, of rockets, and all the exploration
  attached to these (energy, mobility, space) are examples. These were
  improved not by looking back over one's shoulder at people but by
  focusing on the artifacts themselves. Similar things are happening in
  AI right now.

** AI right now
   By way of an outlook - here are the topics featured as part of a major
   AI research program at Stanford U. ([[https://hai.stanford.edu/events/hoffman-yee-symposium][Hoffmann-Yee Research Grants]]) at
   the end of 2021:

   1) Toward grounded, adaptive communication agents
   2) Curious, self-aware AI agents to build cognitive models and
      understand developmental disorders
   3) Intelligent wearable robotic devices for augmenting human
      locomotion
   4) An AI "Time Machine" for investigating the history of concepts
   5) AI tutors to help prepare students for the 21st century workforce

   As you can read in the textbook, AIMA, development of agents (=
   devices that do something, exhibiting "rational behavior") is supposed
   to dominate. Let's take a closer look to see if that's true.

[fn:2]The title is a pun on a famous article by physicist Eugene
Wigner (1960), "[[https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/wigner.pdf][The Unreasonable Effectiveness Of Mathematics In The
Natural Sciences]]", which is worth reading, too.

[fn:1]Without wanting to go into it in great detail: what is, and what
is not scientific knowledge, is of great interest and relevance not
just for AI. In the data modeling seminar the other day, I dissected a
quote by noted psychologist Jean Piaget, which essentially said that
we do not have direct access to reality except through models. Those
of you trained in philosophy, may remember the parable of Plato's
Cave, which is essentially about the same thing but puts God (in
Plato's parable, this is the sun), in the picture, too. In fact, for
God-fearing people, no concept of reality is complete without
Him. There is, fortunately, no real dissent between science and faith
(in fact, for most of human history, the opposite is the case).
