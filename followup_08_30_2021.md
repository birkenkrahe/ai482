## This Week's Must Do's

1.  By Wednesday: identify a (solo) presentation topic and post it
    in the [discussion forum](https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/discussions/4).
2.  By Friday: find a team - 2-3 people with whom to work on the AI
    application challenge prepare for and present at the sprint
    reviews (see [schedule](https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/blob/main/schedule.md)).


## Easiest way to find a topic

Use the textbook, AIMA. Any chapter of that book will be a
suitable presentation topic. In most cases, a whole chapter will
be too much, and a subchapter will suffice: notice that it took us
an entire week to get through chapter 1.1 of AIMA.

The more mathematical chapters, or those dealing with algorithms,
may be more suitable if you have a mathematical mind. If you're
interested in applications and business, focus on that. If you're
into programming and computing tech, go there. Some chapter are
philosophical and deal with difficult questions of ethics etc.

Whatever you pick, make sure that you don't start from a zero
baseline, i.e. assuming nothing. Use the fact that you are seniors
and show off what you already know - stats, algorithms, design,
whatever.

We've discussed other ways of finding topics in the past: e.g. by
taking another book (even a non-fiction book like "Book of Why",
or "Algorithms to live by", "Prediction machines" etc., or a
semi-technical book like "From zero to AI"); by going to an
article in the [bookmarks file](https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/blob/main/bookmarks.md), or any other article that interests
you. Could be a seminal article from the past, like Turing's 1947
paper, or the paper on creating AI that plays checkers by Samuels,
or another article by one of the greats like Marvin Minsky.


## More papers - ideas for presentations or applications

Here are some papers with topics and applications that I found
recently and that I haven't been able to add to the bookmarks file
yet (partly because I'm not sure they're suitable):

Each of these contains one or more interesting ideas and is
difficult, or superficial, or obscure enough to warrant your
efforts to unlock its contents. 


## Creating questions on what you've just learnt

This sounds as difficult as it is! I did not mean for it to sound
trivial, either. There are a few tricks though:

-   Begin with (technical) terms or concepts that you cannot define,
    and ask "what does this mean?"
-   Check out Internet sites like Quora, Stackoverflow, or Reddit
    for questions that others asked about the topic.
-   Post the topic to friends, colleagues or family and ask them
    what they'd like to know<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>.
-   Imagine having to explain the topic to a 5, a 10, a 15 and a
    20-year old person<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>.

# Footnotes

<sup><a id="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> Since everybody is an expert on something else, you'll be
surprised about the questions that you get. They can be quite
hard. Even a question like "how would this benefit me?" can be
enlightening because you may never have thought about it for that
person, who might be a cop, a plummer, an actor or a librarian.

<sup><a id="fn.2" href="#fnr.2">2</a></sup> This is a format that WIRED magazine developed, check out this
video ([WIRED, 2018](#org4f580fe)). I once (as a 22-year-old) spent an entire 8-hour
train ride from Hamburg to Munich in Germany explaining particle
physics to an elderly lady. It really showed me what I did, and what I
did not know (yet).
