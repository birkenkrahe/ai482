## What is this about?

When I find an interesting article or video, I share it here. Most
of these are possible starting points for a short presentation, or
may be useful for your application research.

I usually look at the articles in some detail (though I rarely work
through them - that would be your job), and assign a label for the
difficulty level Lvl = 0 (simple), 1 (moderate), 2 (difficult), or 3
(hard).

Papers can be hard for different reason: length, technical
vocabulary, writing style, mathematics, number of citations etc. If
you find any of these interesting and want to use them for your
research, you might ask me why I assigned a particular level.

## Machine Learning's crumbling foundations (Lvl=0)

Doctorow, C (19 Aug 2021). Machine learning's crumbling
foundations. Doing 'data science' with bad data [Blog]. Online:
[doctorow.medium.com](https://doctorow.medium.com/machine-learnings-crumbling-foundations-bd11efa22b0).

> »Technological debt is insidious, a kind of socio-infrastructural
> subprime crisis that’s unfolding around us in slow motion. Our digital
> infrastructure is built atop layers and layers and layers of code
> that’s insecure due to a combination of bad practices and bad
> frameworks.«

## AI explainability (Lvl=1)

McDermid JA, Jia Y, Porter Z, Habli I. 2021 Artificial
intelligence explainability: the technical and ethical
dimensions. In: Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A 379: 20200363.
<https://doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2020.0363>

> »The use of critical ML-based systems to assist or to replace the human decision-maker raises many
> questions about when, and whether, we should trust them. AI explainability (XAI) methods are
> part of the answer. The use of XAI methods can contribute to building assurance, or justified
> confidence, in critical systems employing ML.«

## Use of AI in smart buildings (LvL=2)

*Literature reviews are among the most important papers, both for beginners (to get an overview), and for experts (to keep their overview) - because they wade through and evaluate many articles in one fell swoop. You may still have to go back to the original source, but no matter what, you'll have saved a lot of time, and learnt a lot, because the authors of literature reviews are often experts themselves (or becoming experts, by writing a literature review). Also, a literature review should be a part of every paper you write, and of every presentation you give.*

Aguilar et al (2021). A systematic literature review on the
use of artificial intelligence in energy self-management in smart
buildings. In: Renewable and Sustainable Energy
Reviews 151. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2021.111530>

> »Buildings are one of the main consumers of energy in cities, which
> is why a lot of research has been generated around this
> problem. Especially, the buildings energy management systems must
> improve in the next years. Artificial intelligence techniques are
> playing and will play a fundamental role in these
> improvements. This work presents a systematic review of the
> literature on researches that have been done in recent years to
> improve energy management systems for smart building using
> artificial intelligence techniques.«

## Computing Machinery and Intelligence (1947)

[Turing AM (1950). Computing Machinery and Intelligence. Mind 49:
433-460.](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf)

> »I propose to consider the question, "Can machines think?" This should begin with
> definitions of the meaning of the terms "machine" and "think." The definitions might be
> framed so as to reflect so far as possible the normal use of the words, but this attitude is
> dangerous, If the meaning of the words "machine" and "think" are to be found by
> examining how they are commonly used it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the
> meaning and the answer to the question, "Can machines think?" is to be sought in a
> statistical survey such as a Gallup poll. But this is absurd.«

## AI Trends 2021

Stanford University, Institute for Human-centered Artificial
Intelligence (2021). AI Index Report. [Online: aiindex.stanford.edu.](https://aiindex.stanford.edu/report/)

> "The 2021 report also shows the effects of COVID-19 on AI development
> from multiple perspectives. The Technical Performance chapter
> discusses how an AI startup used machine-learning-based techniques to
> accelerate COVID-related drug discovery during the pandemic, and our
> Economy chapter suggests that AI hiring and private investment were
> not significantly adversely influenced by the pandemic, as both grew
> during 2020. If anything, COVID-19 may have led to a higher number of
> people participating in AI research conferences, as the pandemic
> forced conferences to shift to virtual formats, which in turn led to
> significant spikes in attendance."
