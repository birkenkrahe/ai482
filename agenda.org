** Homework

   Please prepare our session on "AI for Natural Language" on November
   1 with some self-study:

   1) To get going, watch 5 minutes of this video (from [[https://youtu.be/ISa10TrJK7w?t=115][here]] to
      [[https://youtu.be/ISa10TrJK7w?t=367][here]]) - recent coding successes with AI using natural
      language. This shows recent successes with the GPT-3 model.

   2) Read chapter 5 of "Zero to AI" ([[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MVSgQhbCX5c2Km7Pjdcy6NiZp3RgauB3/view?usp=sharing][PDF]]). This is a non-technical
      discussion of different Natural Language Processing (NLP)
      applications. Some questions that you should be able to answer
      afterwards:
      * Which two metrics are used to measure NLP performance?
      * Why is sentiment analysis a classification problem?
      * What does OpenAI's GPT-2 model do?
      * How does ~BrokerBot~ differ from ~Eliza~ the therapist bot?
      * Which tasks can be automated by AI according to the founder of
        the company featured in the case study at the end?

** Data science guest speaker, November 18, 11:45 Maxwell Room

   From Dr. Wesley Beal (Lyon):

   #+begin_quote
   I'm hosting a speaker for the HFP on Thursday, and if you or any of
   your students would be interested in his talk you're more than
   welcome to attend. Please consider spreading the word.

   * Michael Simeone, director of Data Science and Analytics at
     Arizona State University, will deliver a talk entitled “Beyond
     ‘Fake News’: A Study in How to Study Misinformation" on Thursday,
     Nov 18 from 11:45-12:50. We will meet in the Maxfield Room, and
     he will join us remotely; we're allowed to bring lunches
     downstairs from the cafeteria. Dr. Simeone will discuss current,
     data-driven research on misinformation. Dr. Simeone also co-hosts
     a podcast, Misinfo Weekly. I asked him which episodes he would
     recommend for students interested in getting a head start on his
     talk, and here's what he suggested:
   * S1E1 on Information literacy:  https://play.acast.com/s/misinfo-weekly/episode-1
   * S1E8 on Instagram and "COVID parties": https://play.acast.com/s/misinfo-weekly/covid-parties
   * S1E7 on the Wayfair furniture conspiracy: https://play.acast.com/s/misinfo-weekly/the-wayfair-conspiracy-expensive-furniture-or-a-front-for-ch

   May or may not be the kind of content you're interested in, but I

* Footnotes

[fn:6]Actually, "Du kannst mich mal gerne haben" (German) means "Bite
me."  While "jemanden gerne haben" means "to like someone", the
operational part of the German sentence is "Du kannst mich mal", which
is correctly machine translated as "Bite me." But the last part is
inserted to soften it (typically used like this in the South of
Germany).

[fn:5]This is a really nice video that gives a little more insight
into the technical aspects of NLP. Clearly an attempt to reroute
people to IBM Watson, which you should check out.

[fn:4]See the [[https://youtu.be/ISa10TrJK7w?t=115][first minutes of this video]] (Neura Pod, 2021) for recent
progress in machine translation using the new GPT-3 language
generating algorithm. The GitHub pilot for this application
(AI-supported coding with natural language) [[https://copilot.github.com/][is here]]. I am on the
waiting list...

[fn:3]If we've got extra time to spare after a presentation, or if we
don't have a presenter, we'll work through this video to get a glimpse
of some of the exciting new developments in AI. Neuralink is a company
founded by Elon Musk that "is going to change how humans think, act,
learn, and share information."

[fn:2]I will only give this lecture if we run out of presentations -
either in a session (because your presentations are finished, and
there is nothing else to discuss, or because you're all done
presenting solo).

[fn:1]"Structured group discussion" means that I'm providing a
framework for group discussion and group results (e.g. a set of
questions), and a timeline. Your job is to execute the framework
within the allotted time and present the results as good as you
can. For participation, only participating and trying (harder) is
evaluated, not the quality of the result itself.
