** Homework

   Please prepare our session on "AI for Natural Language" on November
   1 with some self-study:

   1) To get going, watch 5 minutes of this video (from [[https://youtu.be/ISa10TrJK7w?t=115][here]] to
      [[https://youtu.be/ISa10TrJK7w?t=367][here]]) - recent coding successes with AI using natural
      language. This shows recent successes with the GPT-3 model.

   2) Read chapter 5 of "Zero to AI" ([[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MVSgQhbCX5c2Km7Pjdcy6NiZp3RgauB3/view?usp=sharing][PDF]]). This is a non-technical
      discussion of different Natural Language Processing (NLP)
      applications. Some questions that you should be able to answer
      afterwards:
      * Which two metrics are used to measure NLP performance?
      * Why is sentiment analysis a classification problem?
      * What does OpenAI's GPT-2 model do?
      * How does ~BrokerBot~ differ from ~Eliza~ the therapist bot?
      * Which tasks can be automated by AI according to the founder of
        the company featured in the case study at the end?

* Footnotes

[fn:4]See the [[https://youtu.be/ISa10TrJK7w?t=115][first minutes of this video]] (Neura Pod, 2021) for recent
progress in machine translation using the new GPT-3 language
generating algorithm. The GitHub pilot for this application
(AI-supported coding with natural language) [[https://copilot.github.com/][is here]]. I am on the
waiting list...

[fn:3]If we've got extra time to spare after a presentation, or if we
don't have a presenter, we'll work through this video to get a glimpse
of some of the exciting new developments in AI. Neuralink is a company
founded by Elon Musk that "is going to change how humans think, act,
learn, and share information."

[fn:2]I will only give this lecture if we run out of presentations -
either in a session (because your presentations are finished, and
there is nothing else to discuss, or because you're all done
presenting solo).

[fn:1]"Structured group discussion" means that I'm providing a
framework for group discussion and group results (e.g. a set of
questions), and a timeline. Your job is to execute the framework
within the allotted time and present the results as good as you
can. For participation, only participating and trying (harder) is
evaluated, not the quality of the result itself.
