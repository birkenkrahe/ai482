    Dear course participants -
    
    These are the instructions for handing in the final presentation
    material. Please read them carefully, follow them to the letter
    and contact me immediately if there are issues or
    mistakes<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. Submit earlier, not in the last minute, to be on
    the safe side!
    
    The deadline for submitting the presentation is **December 5, 12AM
    CST** (Sunday midnight in Batesville).
    
    1.  **Sign** this honor sheet and write **"pledged"** next to your
        name.
    
    2.  Upload your **presentation documents** and the **scan of the
        signed honor sheet** to this GitHub folder - please put your
        name(s) into the title.
    
    3.  Post the **link** to your video presentation [to the discussion
        forum](https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ai482/discussions) in GitHub<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>. Test the link before posting it!
    
    4.  When you're done, **send me an email** confirming that you've
        done all of this, including which course you're in.
    
    5.  Await my formative (comments) and summative (grade) feedback.


# Footnotes

<sup><a id="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> Please be advised that I'm traveling in Europe between November
29 and December 15 (communication of final rades), and will not be
easily reachable.

<sup><a id="fn.2" href="#fnr.2">2</a></sup> Start a `New discussion` and make sure that your name(s) appear
in the subject line of the post. Do **not post the video itself** since
GitHub has limited space available. Use GDrive, Vimeo or YouTube
(unlisted) instead.
